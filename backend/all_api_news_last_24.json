        "lead": "MAGACOIN FINANCE, an Ethereum-based meme coin, has raised over $15.5 million in presale funding, attracting significant investor attention due to its strong presale performance and Ethereum network infrastructure.",
        "text": "NEW YORK, Oct. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- When a presale crosses into the double-digit millions, the crypto market pays attention. That’s exactly what’s happening with MAGACOIN FINANCE, an Ethereum-based meme coin that has now surpassed $15.5 million in presale funding. The achievement cements its position as one of the most closely watched early-stage altcoins heading into 2025.Presale Momentum AcceleratesUnlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is structuring its growth with a presale model that has already attracted thousands of early buyers. According to analyst reports, the project’s presale allocation has consistently sold out in consecutive stages, highlighting real investor demand rather than short-lived speculation.This rapid momentum is being noticed across the altcoin market. Ethereum’s established infrastructure gives MAGACOIN FINANCE strong fundamentals for scaling, while its community-driven positioning appeals to the same investor segments that powered Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to mainstream awareness.Why Analysts Are Watching MAGACOIN FINANCECrypto analysts point to several factors driving confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE:Strong presale traction: With over $15.5M raised, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already outpacing many presales that struggled to break the $5M threshold.Ethereum-based reliability: Built on the Ethereum network, it benefits from ERC-20 compatibility, liquidity access, and smart contract security.Analyst coverage: Multiple market reports now reference MAGACOIN FINANCE as an emerging contender in the meme coin sector.Upcoming catalysts: Exchange listing speculation, staking rewards, and presale milestones are all drawing investor attention.Top crypto commentators have also noted that while meme coins often rise and fall quickly, those with early exchange adoption and strong presale traction can deliver some of the highest returns in altcoin history.Market Context: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPThe timing of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise aligns with broader market narratives. Bitcoin remains steady near key technical levels, Ethereum continues to benefit from institutional adoption, and XRP is in the spotlight amid ETF speculation. These dynamics create fertile ground for altcoin presales that position themselves as low-entry, high-upside opportunities.For investors seeking exposure beyond the majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a viable alternative entry point — one that combines Ethereum’s technical advantages with meme coin–style cultural relevance.Presale Growth Ahead of 2025With its $15.5M milestone achieved, the next phase of MAGACOIN FINANCE will be defined by continued presale stages and preparation for exchange listings. Analysts suggest that early buyers may be positioned for high-multiple upside once broader market participation begins.Importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already passed a security audit from HashEx, with a Certik audit underway — a critical factor in reinforcing legitimacy and separating it from low-quality meme coin launches.Unique HookThe crossing of the $15.5M presale mark represents more than just a funding milestone. It signals that MAGACOIN FINANCE has achieved community-driven momentum before its first exchange listing, placing it in a rare category of meme coins that show both grassroots energy and institutional analyst attention.Final OutlookWhile the presale market is crowded, few projects have managed to secure the dual position of Ethereum-backed infrastructure and viral meme coin appeal. MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out exactly that niche, positioning itself as one of the best crypto presales to watch heading into 2025..With exchange listings on the horizon and a rapidly growing investor community, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract coverage as a high-conviction entry for smart money participants.For more information, please visit:Website:https://magacoinfinance.comX:https://x.com/magacoinfinanceTelegram:https://t.me/magacoinfinanceContact DetailsPR Specialist: Rebecca MilesEmail:rebecca@magacoinfinance.comDisclaimer: This content is provided by MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) a top demand side platform (“DSP”) buyer was shifting a significant number of clients to a new platform which evaluated inventory differently; (2) as a result, PubMatic was seeing a reduction in ad spend and revenue from this top DSP buyer; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about PubMatic’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

        "title": "Where Will Target Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "lead": "Target, a major U.S. retailer, has experienced significant stock value decline from its 2021 peak due to pandemic aftermath, inflation, and political challenges. Despite difficulties, the company aims to grow revenue and maintain its Dividend King status by focusing on private labels, marketplace expansion, and technological improvements.",
        "text": "Target (TGT-0.54%), one of the largest retailers in America, was once considered a dependable blue-chip stock for dividend investors. On November 26, 2021, its stock closed at a record high of $238.01 per share, marking a three-year gain of 234%.Target impressed the bulls with its soaring digital sales throughout the pandemic, the expansion of its private-label brands, and its overall pricing power. The broader buying frenzy in stocks -- which was sparked by stimulus checks, social media buzz, and the growing popularity of commission-free trading platforms -- further inflated its valuations.Image source: Getty Images.After hitting its peak, Target's stock shed more than two-thirds of its value and now trades at around $88 a share. The company lost its luster as it grappled with tough comparisons to the pandemic, rising inventory levels, inflationary headwinds, tariffs, and politically driven boycotts. As it dealt with those challenges, risinginterest ratescompressed its valuations.Target's stock now trades at just 12 timesforward earningsand pays a high forward yield of 5.2%. It's also still aDividend Kingthat has raised its payout annually for 54 consecutive years. It takes 50 straight years of dividend increases to qualify for that elite club. Target's low valuation and high yield might limit its downside potential, but can it bounce back and outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years?What happened to Target over the past few years?From fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this February), Target's comparable-store sales cooled off significantly from its pandemic-era highs. The inflationary headwinds for consumer spending and thefluctuating tariffson Chinese goods exacerbated that slowdown. Yet Target continued to open new stores, even as manyother retailersshuttered their weaker brick-and-mortar stores, and its gross margins bounced back from a steep post-pandemic drop in 2022.MetricFY 2021FY 2022FY 2023FY 2024Comps growth12.7%2.2%(3.7%)0.1%Store count1,9261,9481,9561,978Gross margin28.3%23.6%27.5%28.2%Data source: Target. FY = fiscal year.Target is still much smaller than rch rival Walmart, which operates more than 10,750 stores worldwide. The company also only operates its stores within the U.S. and generally targets more affluent and style-conscious consumers than Walmart. That's why it often prioritizes sales of clothing and home decor over essentials and groceries. However, those non-essential products were more exposed to the recent macro headwinds than essential goods.As Target grappled with those challenges, it faced boycotts from both right-wing and left-leaning groups. Its sales of LGBTQ-themed merchandise sparked a conservative boycott in 2024, while the rollback of its diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) initiatives in early 2025 caused liberal shoppers to boycott its stores. To make matters worse, its shrink rate (largely caused by theft) rose, as more shoplifters targeted its stores in certain cities.In fiscal 2022, Target's gross margin plummeted as it tried to clear out its excess inventories with markdowns. But over the following two years, its gross margins expanded as it negotiated better prices with its suppliers, diversified its supply chain, generated more revenue from its higher-margin advertising and marketplace segments, and improved its product mix while gaining more Target Circle 360 subscriptions. Those improvements offset the pressure from its markdowns, higher fulfillment costs, and unpredictable tariffs.What will happen to Target over the next five years?For fiscal 2025, Target expects its comps to drop by the low single digits as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS), which excludes its litigation-related gains in the first quarter, decline by a midpoint of 10%. It expects most of its prior challenges to persist throughout the rest of the year.On the bright side, Target still expects to add $15 billion to its top line by 2030 -- which implies its revenue could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% from $105.1 billion in fiscal 2025 to $120.1 billion in fiscal 2030. To achieve that long-term goal, it plans to beef up its private label brands, draw more shoppers to its third-party Target Plus marketplace, upgrade its artificial intelligence(AI) and recommendationtools, streamline its supply chain, expand its in-house media and advertising units, and gain even more Circle 360 subscribers. It also plans to open new stores, leverage those locations to fulfill its online orders, and further improve its same-day delivery and curbside pickup services.Assuming Target hits that modest target, its EPS grows at a similar CAGR of 3% from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2030, and the stock trades at a more generous 15 times forward earnings by the final year, the company's stock could rise nearly 60%, to $140 per share, over the next five years. That gain could keep it ahead of the S&P 500, which generates an average annual return of about 10%.However, that's based on a best-case scenario in which Target comfortably overcomes all of its macro, competitive, shrink-related, and politically driven challenges. If it doesn't resolve those issues, Target's valuation could remain depressed as the stock continues to underperform the broader market.",

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the business impact and sustainability of a purportedly “record” round of FortiGate unit upgrades. Defendants represented that this “refresh cycle” was “by far the largest we’ve seen probably ever,” would generate “around $400 million to $450 million in product revenue” in 2025 and 2026, and would create strong opportunities to cross-sell additional products and services. Defendants also represented that the refresh cycle would “gain momentum” in the second half of 2025 and beyond.The lawsuit alleges these statements were materially false and misleading. In truth, defendants knew that the refresh cycle would never be as lucrative as they represented because it consisted of old products that were a “small percentage” of the Company’s business. Moreover, defendants misrepresented and concealed that they did not have a clear picture of the true number of FortiGate firewalls that could be upgraded. And while telling investors that the refresh would gain momentum over the course of two years, Fortinet misrepresented and concealed that it had aggressively pushed through roughly half of the refresh in a period of just a few months, by the end of 2Q 2025. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Fortinet class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45210or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or emailcase@rosenlegal.comfor information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified.

If you invested $10,000 in Apple stock a decade ago, here's how much you'd have today.Crushing the marketA company doesn't get to be valued in the trillions of dollars without taking care of its investors. This is what Apple has done. In the past 10 years, the business has generated a total return of 938% (as of Sept. 30), which would have seen a $10,000 starting sum turn into an incredible $103,800.This gain significantly outperforms the broader S&P 500. The closely watched index has put up a total return of 321% during the same time.Key factors driving returnsInvestors should understand what variables supported Apple's returns. In this instance,net incomewas up 119% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2025 (ended June 28). The business has been able to sell more of its devices, like the iPhone, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods, over time. What's more, Apple's services division is growing at a double-digit pace and posts a high gross margin.The other key factor supporting the stock has beenvaluation expansion. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio, which currently sits at 38.6, has increased by 207% in the past decade.",

        "title": "Where Will Plug Power Be in 25 Years?",
        "lead": "Plug Power, a hydrogen fuel cell company, has struggled to achieve profitability despite promising renewable energy technology. While hydrogen fuel shows potential, significant challenges remain in cost-competitiveness and technology adoption.",
        "text": "Plug Power (PLUG35.16%) held itsIPOin 1999. At the time, investors were enthusiastic about the company's business model, which promised to usher in a new era of renewable energy usinghydrogen fuel cells. Within months, shares zoomed higher from a split-adjusted $160 per share to more than $1,300 per share.The excitement did not last. The dot-com bubble soon burst, and Plug Power's stock price gradually fell in value by more than 99%. However, we are in a much different world more than 25 years after Plug Power's IPO. Hydrogen fuel cells are arguably more powerful and efficient than ever. Demand projections, meanwhile, have picked up given a growing global emphasis on clean-burning fuels.How will the next 25 years play out for Plug Power? There are three important questions to monitor.1. Will hydrogen demand finally materialize at scale?The global hydrogen revolution is just around the corner -- or at least that's what hydrogen companies have been telling investors for decades. Indeed, every now and again we get research reports suggesting that global hydrogen demand is about to scale significantly. A 2023 report by McKinsey & Company, for example, stated that \"global clean hydrogen demand is projected to grow significantly to 2050.\" Within 12 months, the consultancy firm was forced to lower its long-term demand estimates by 10% to 25% across the board.In theory, hydrogen fuel is a fantastic tool for realizing a carbon-free future. So-called \"green hydrogen\" can be produced using renewable energy sources, generating an energy-dense and portable fuel source that can be used in carbon-intensive applications like aviation.The problem, for the most part, has been cost. When McKinsey lowered its demand forecast, it did so largely because hydrogen technologies simply aren't very cost-competitive with existing fuel sources. The company noted that hydrogen costs have risen by 20% to 40% since its original forecast, leaving potential adopters little incentive to ramp usage. Some experts believe hydrogen may be cost-competitive by 2030, but that would still require government incentives. And as we'll discuss next, which specific type of hydrogen fuel technology will succeed is still up for debate.2. Which hydrogen technologies will actually succeed?Several major types of hydrogen energy technologies exist today. Proton exchange membranes are suitable for applications that require quick start-up times and high power density, like cars, buses, and planes. Solid oxide fuel cells, on the other hand, are more suitable for stationary, large-scale power generation, such as powering a factory or supplementing grid variability. Anion exchange membranes, meanwhile, sport lower production costs but face durability and efficiency challenges.As with any emerging technology, dozens of companies around the world are investing to drive costs lower, push efficiencies higher, and create form factors that could gain real world adoption over time. Which technology will win over the long term remains unknown. For its part, Plug Power specializes in proton exchange membrane systems. There is a possible future, however, where hydrogen fuel demand skyrockets, but the demand is driven by the growing electricity demands ofdata centers-- an application that isn't as well suited for Plug Power's specific technology.So, over the next 25 years, it won't just matter what happens to hydrogen demand. Investors must also understand which applications are driving this demand, and whether or not they will benefit Plug Power specifically.Image source: Getty Images.3. Can Plug Power survive financially for another 25 years?The first two questions regarding long-term demand growth and the specific hydrogen technology being adopted will have huge consequences for Plug Power. Whether or not Plug Power can survive financially to see these questions answered is another issue altogether.Over the last 25 years, Plug Power has struggled to achieve profitability. Huge government subsidies, plus massiveshare dilution, have kept the company afloat for now. But there's no denying the obvious: Plug Power is surviving on borrowed time. The company posted anet lossof $227 million last quarter. That's nearly 10% of its entire market cap.Of course, a huge bump in demand for Plug Power's hydrogen systems could change all of this in a hurry. But as we've seen, there are huge questions surrounding when and if that will happen. So while envisioning another 25-year run for Plug Power is an interesting exercise, whether the company can survive financially for that long remains an open question.",

        "title": "Beyond Streaming: Netflix's Quiet Moves Into Gaming and Live Experiences",
        "lead": "Netflix is diversifying its business model by exploring gaming, immersive venues, live sports, and entertainment, aiming to transform from a pure streaming platform into a broader entertainment ecosystem.",
        "text": "Netflix (NFLX-0.80%) has built its empire on streaming video content, but the company isn't content to stop there. While investors focus on its subscriber growth and ad revenue, Netflix is quietly laying the groundwork for new frontiers: gaming, immersive real-world venues, and live sports and other events.These initiatives may not move the needle today, but they reveal Netflix's ambitions to be more than just a content platform. The big question for investors: Are these side bets a distraction from Netflix's core, or could they evolve into meaningful growth engines?1. A push into gamingNetflix's interactive experiments, such as Bandersnatch, which allowed viewers to pick the direction of the story, are fading away. Instead, the company is building an actual gaming business across four categories: party games, narrative titles, children's games, and mainstream hits.Recent steps show Netflix is serious. It licensed blockbuster titles like Grand Theft Auto V for mobile, is developing original projects such as Thronglets -- in which \"you manage an ever-growing population of the little yellow guys\" -- and is testing cloud-based gaming on smart TVs, where most Netflix viewing already happens. Phones serve as controllers, lowering friction for users.But execution remains uneven. Engagement is still limited, with only a small fraction of subscribers regularly playing games. A recent studio closure and leadership changes underscore the challenges of scaling.For investors, the upside is clear. Gaming could strengthen engagement and open new ways tomake money from online users. The risk is equally obvious. Games are expensive, and Netflix hasn't yet proven it can compete in a crowded industry.2. Netflix House: Bringing IP into the real worldLater this year, Netflix plans to open its first Netflix House locations in Philadelphia and Dallas. These venues will feature themed dining, merchandise, virtual reality activities, and interactive experiences tied to hit franchises like Stranger Things and Squid Game.This approach borrows from Disney's playbook, turningintellectual propertyinto real-world touchpoints. If successful, Netflix House could deepen fan engagement and add incremental revenue beyond subscriptions.While still niche, it demonstrates Netflix's broader goal: stretching its content into multiple formats to strengthen loyalty and brand stickiness.3. Live events and sportsNetflix once dismissed live programming, but that stance has shifted.The company recently signed a three-year deal with the NFL to stream Christmas Day games through 2027. It also committed $5 billion over 10 years for exclusive streaming rights to WWE's Monday Night Raw. And Netflix locked in exclusive rights to the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women's World Cups in the U.S. and Canada.On the entertainment side, Netflix is also leaning into variety. This year, it launched Everybody's Live with John Mulaney, a weekly live talk show airing every Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET. Add in one-off comedy specials and fan events, and the message is clear: Netflix is no longer a pure on-demand service.Live programming offers two advantages: it attractsadvertisers, and it helps reducechurnby giving subscribers reasons to tune in at specific times. The challenge, however, lies in execution. Rights are expensive, and Netflix must prove it can translate these moves into sustainable profits in a space long dominated by traditional broadcasters.The bigger pictureGaming, immersive venues, and live sports don't move the financial needle yet. Netflix still generates the bulk of itsrevenuefromstreamingsubscriptions and is only beginning to monetize its ad-supported tier, where users pay less and see ads.But these initiatives serve two crucial purposes:Reduce reliance on shows and films.Add future revenue streams.What does it mean for investors?For investors, the key is patience. Netflix is planting seeds, not harvestingprofits. Some projects may fail, but even one breakout success could expand its long-term growth runway.Netflix's quiet moves beyond streaming show a company unwilling to stand still. Gaming, live events, and real-world venues all carry execution risks, but they also highlight Netflix's ambition to evolve into a broader entertainment platform.These bets don't change the investment thesis today, but they give Netflix long-term optionality. It's a stock thatgrowth investorsshould track closely.",

        "lead": "The Trade Desk partnered with DirecTV to co-develop a custom version of its Ventura TV operating system, aiming to create a neutral platform for smart TV advertising with improved transparency and efficiency.",
        "text": "The first big customer for The Trade Desk's (TTD1.33%) TV operating system (OS) is finally here. The ad-buying platform announced on Wednesday that it will co-develop a custom version of its Ventura TV OS with DirecTV, pairing DirecTV's consumer interface with Ventura's ad-tech plumbing and app store. The announcement arrives nearly a year after Ventura was introduced, giving investors their first look at how the company plans to bring its TV platform to market.For readers newer to the story, The Trade Desk operates a software platform that helps advertisers buy and measure digital ads across the internet. The company has been pushing deeper into connected TV (CTV) for years. Ventura is the boldest step yet -- a TV operating system meant to give manufacturers and content companies an alternative to platforms that also own content or astreaming service.Image source: Getty Images.What Ventura is and why DirecTV mattersVentura is pitched as a neutral operating system for smart TVs and other screens. The company said in its announcement of Ventura that it is designed to provide a \"much cleaner supply chain streaming TV advertising, minimizing supply chain hops and costs -- ensuring maximum ROI for every advertising dollar and optimized yield for publishers.\" In other words, The Trade Desk believes it will support a supply chain that lets advertisers measure performance more precisely and ultimately optimize spending better.Importantly, Ventura is not tied to a house streaming service, which the company argues reduces conflicts of interest and keeps it a more unbiased partner for publishers, TV makers, and retailers. This is a pointed contrast with incumbents like Roku or Amazon's Fire TV, which operate platforms while also owning major ad-supported channels and inventory.DirecTV gives Ventura an on-ramp that consumers recognize. The partners plan to integrate DirecTV's familiar interface -- including access to MyFree DirecTV (its free ad-supported TV service), optional genre packs, and premium bundles -- into a Ventura build that any third-party TV manufacturer, retailer, hotel, or venue could deploy.In other words, an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) can ship a TV that boots into DirecTV's experience, but the advertising marketplace and measurement behind the scenes will run on Ventura. As Matthew Henick, senior vice president of Ventura TV OS, put it, \"TV manufacturers deserve more choice in how they build their businesses,\" adding that the goal is a \"more transparent and equitable ecosystem\" for advertisers and publishers.Financially, The Trade Desk enters this next phase during a time when investors are dubious about how sustainable its high growth rate is. Second-quarter revenue grew 19% year over year to $694 million, and customer retention stayed above 95% while adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin was an impressive 39%. But this growth rate was down from Q1, and management expects even lower growth in Q3. While tough comparisons to year-ago quarters (due primarily to political advertising spending last year) are weighing on results, some investors worry that increasing competition is also to blame.A catalyst -- and a potential distractionA credible distribution partner could help The Trade Desk push Ventura into living rooms quickly. If OEMs adopt this DirecTV-skinned version, Ventura may improve ad transparency, streamline supply paths, and potentially lower take rates in CTV -- outcomes that could make its core ad-buying platform more attractive as its marketers benefit from better economics when buying Ventura OS inventory.But investors should be cautious about extrapolating too much from a single partnership. Building and supporting a TV OS is expensive and operationally messy. The business model relies on lining up multiple constituents (OEMs, publishers, retailers, and distribution partners) and then demonstrating that stakeholders can earn more money on Ventura than on incumbent platforms. That process takes time. It is also possible the effort will distract management from the day-to-day of strengthening Kokai, itsartificial intelligence (AI)-forward ad-buying platform.Additionally, The Trade Desk'svaluationarguably already prices in success with both its core business and in new ventures. Even after a tough stretch for the stock, shares trade at close to 10times sales-- a premium that implies steady execution and continued share gains across CTV and the open internet. If Ventura ramps slowly, or ifmacroeconomicheadwinds suppress large brands' ad budgets (as The Trade Desk management warned of in its last earnings call), that premium may be hard to defend. And competition isn't standing still: Platform owners with their own channels can bundle distribution, data, and ad inventory in ways Ventura will need to match, with clear economic benefits for partners.None of this diminishes the strategic logic. If Ventura delivers an OS that reduces friction for viewers and advertisers while improving monetization for content owners, this could lead to a cleaner and more efficient supply chain for CTV, ultimately benefiting The Trade Desk's core platform and making it more valuable over time. The DirecTV tie-up is an important first step toward testing that thesis in the wild.",

        "title": "2 Problems Rivian, Lucid, and Tesla Will Face After the EV Tax Credit Expiration",
        "lead": "Electric vehicle manufacturers Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid face significant financial challenges due to the elimination of U.S. tax credits and CAFE regulatory credits by September 30, 2025, which will likely reduce EV demand and eliminate a profitable revenue stream.",
        "text": "Earlier this year,electric car stocksacross the board saw sharp declines after the U.S. government revealed that several critical EV subsidies would be eliminated. Since then, however, most of those initial losses have been erased. Yet the effect of these subsidies being eliminated remains.If you have money invested in Lucid Group (LCID2.68%), Rivian (RIVN0.85%), or Tesla (TSLA-1.41%), be sure to understand the two problems below that all three of these automakers will face very soon.1. Electric car demand may be lower than expectedGovernments around the world have been offering incentives that lower the price of EVs for customers since the 1990s. In 2010, the U.S. began offering consumers a tax credit that ranged between $2,500 and $7,500 when buying a new or used electric vehicle. There were rules related to which cars qualified and who exactly could receive the credit. But all in all, these tax credits deployed billions of dollars to lower the upfront cost of buying an electric vehicle.On Sept. 30, 2025, these tax credits will be formally eliminated. This effectively raises the final cost of an EV by up to $7,500. At a time when nearly 70% of Americans are hoping to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase, the elimination of this subsidy should immediately hit EV demand. Already, we're seeing a small but noticeable bump in EV purchases -- a signal that people who have sat on the fence are buying before thetax creditsexpire. The reasonable implication here is that buyers are paying attention to tax credits, and prefer buying when these credits will apply to their purchases.The takeaway: Expect EV demand to be lower in 2026 than previously expected. To counteract this, EV makers may be forced to cut prices, stoking demand, but reducinggross profits. Critically, both Lucid and Rivian expect to start production on vehicles with prices under $50,000 over the next six to 24 months. These budget vehicles are intended to massively increase theirtotal addressable markets. Should those newer models have qualified, they will now be missing a key subsidy that would have made them even more attractive to cost-conscious buyers.Image source: Getty Images.2. This little-known multi-billion-dollar subsidy won't exist in 2026Many EV investors are already aware of the U.S. tax credits that are set to expire at the end of September. However, most don't realize that there's another program about to be axed that is equally valuable: CAFE regulatory credits, which are credits earned by auto manufacturers that exceed fuel economy standards.As EV producers, Tesla, Lucid, and Rivian all earn credits under this program. These companies then sell these credits to other automakers that would otherwise face fines for not producing enough low-emission vehicles. Because these credits are earned automatically, they can be sold at essentially 100% profit margins.The value of this little-understood program is immense. Tesla routinely earned billions of dollars per year from this program, accounting for 10% to 30% of its gross profit. Rivian has already told investors that it wouldn't realize $100 million in revenue from the sale of its credits, since these credits are no longer worth anything. Fines for non-compliance have been eliminated, taking away any incentive for competing automakers to value and purchase these credits. Lucid, too, has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in \"free\" profit from this program.The elimination of the consumer tax credit will hit EV demand. But the elimination of automotive regulatory credits like this will have an equally damaging effect. Rivian and Lucid are still struggling for profitability, and now they will lose a highly profitable revenue source. Tesla, meanwhile, has benefited the most from this program on a sheer volume basis. The elimination of these credits may not make headlines, but it poses problems for all three companies in 2026 and beyond.",

        "lead": "Uber has demonstrated significant growth, transforming from a money-losing operation to a profitable company with a strong network effect. The company dominates the ride-hailing market, has expanded to 15,000 cities, and shows potential for continued expansion through technological innovation and strategic partnerships.",
        "text": "This year has seen a continuation of the ongoing artificial intelligence craze. Besides that, investors have been faced with uncertainty around trade policy and the Federal Reserve's next moves. This can be a lot to deal with.This macro backdrop hasn't gotten in Uber Technologies' (UBER-0.08%) way. Its shares have rocketed 60% higher in 2025 (as of Oct. 1). They are trading just slightly off their record high, demonstrating the market's bullishness toward the business. There could still be upside.Here are three reasons investors might want to buy thisconsumer discretionary stocklike there's no tomorrow.Image source: Getty Images.1. Despite huge gains, Uber still has growth potentialThe disruption that Uber's tech platform has caused in the past nearly two decades is unbelievable. It might have felt crazy getting into a stranger's car in the early days, but now this is the new normal.The company has rapidly grown, and it now has a presence in 15,000 cities around the world. Itsrevenueand monthly active users (MAUs) have surged 57% and 48%, respectively, just in the past three years, a clear sign of broader adoption of the platform. Uber dominates in the U.S., commanding 75% market share in the ride-hailing industry.During the second quarter, gross bookings totaled $187 billion on an annualized basis, underscoring the impressive scale Uber has these days. However, there is still lots of growth potential, with the company focusing on some key areas of improvement.Getting riders to use the service more frequently can unlock more gross bookings and revenue. Frequency might get a boost should the cost per mile of travel come down. And this could happen if autonomous vehicle technology (more on this below) advances significantly to the point of broader adoption.There are 36 million Uber One members. These users spend three times the amount as non-members. Getting more people to sign up for this subscription can be extremely lucrative.Uber has leaned on its network to launch adjacent services as well. The app sells ad space to businesses and restaurants looking to target a wide audience. Uber is leveraging all the data it has to generate more revenue.2. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has focused on increasing profitsDara Khosrowshahi became CEO in 2017, taking over from founder Travis Kalanick. This marked a transition in Uber's history, as the company upgraded itself from a money-losing operation to an extremely profitable entity. Khosrowshahi focused his efforts on creating a more efficient business that's financially sound.Uber's operating income increased 82% year over year in Q2 to $1.5 billion. This helped generate almost $2.5 billion infree cash flow. Management is so confident in the trajectory of the bottom line that it instituted a fresh $20 billion stock buyback program.According to the management team, Uber's adjustedEBITDAis set to increase at a compound annual rate of 35% to 40% between 2024 and 2027. Wall Street's assessment isn't as robust, but analysts expect the company's EBITDA to rise at a yearly clip of 28% between 2024 and 2027.At a high level, it makes sense why Uber can continue to squeeze higher profits from the business. Think about every additional ride or delivery that happens on the platform. Because the technological infrastructure is already built out, these transactions should carry high margins.3. It's difficult to disrupt a powerful network effectThe third reason to buy Uber shares is because of itsnetwork effect. Being able to amass 180 million MAUs, 8.8 million drivers and couriers, and over 1 million merchants is no easy feat. And at this stage, Uber has become so valuable to all of its stakeholders that it's difficult to see the business being disrupted.Autonomous vehicles could pose a threat, especially if Tesla's robotaxis lower trip costs and become introduced worldwide. But Uber is positioning itself as a partner of choice forenterprises that are working on this tech. Uber's advantage is that it's the top aggregator of a massive pool of demand, not to mention the technical expertise it has running the platform. For a company in the space that wants to scale quickly, working with Uber is a smart choice.Uber's ongoing growth, profit potential, and network effect make it a sound investment.",

Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)Class Period: October 30, 2023, to May 20, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 11, 2025The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors regarding VFC's turnaround plans while concealing material adverse facts about the true state of those plans;(2) Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose that additional significant reset actions would be necessary to return the Vans brand to growth, resulting in substantial setbacks to Vans' revenue growth trajectory; (3) These setbacks were neither contemplated nor cautioned in Defendants' public commentary on the Reinvent initiative or the Vans turnaround progress; and (4) As a result, Defendants' statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading at all relevant times, causing Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase VFC's securities at artificially inflated prices.For more information on the VFC lawsuit go to:https://bespc.com/cases/VFCCytokinetics, Incorporated (NASDAQ:CYTK)Class Period: December 27, 2023 to May 6, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 17, 2025According to the complaint, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the timeline for the New Drug Application (“NDA”) submission and approval process for aficamten. Specifically, defendants represented that the Company expected approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for its NDA for aficamten in the second half of 2025, based on a September 26, 2025 PDUFA date, and failed to disclose material risks related to the Company’s failure to submit a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) that could delay the regulatory process.On May 6, 2025, during an earnings call, it was revealed that the Company had multiple pre-NDA meetings with the FDA discussing safety monitoring and risk mitigation but chose to submit the NDA without a REMS, relying on labeling and voluntary education materials. This confirmed defendants’ awareness of potential REMS requirements and their reckless decision to omit it from the initial submission, misleading investors about the regulatory timeline.As a result of defendants’ false and misleading statements, class members purchased Cytokinetics’ common stock at artificially inflated prices and suffered significant losses when the truth was revealed.For more information on the Cytokinetics lawsuit go to:https://bespc.com/cases/CYTKQuanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX)Class Period: December 12, 2024 to September 5, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 18, 2025The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects.

The Company attributed the decline to “softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics.” As a result of the setback in sales, defendants revised the Company’s 2025 financial outlook lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%.Following this news, Tronox’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $5.14 per share on July 30, 2025, Tronox’s stock price fell to $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, a decline of about 38% in the span of just a single day.For more information on the Tronox lawsuit go to:https://bespc.com/cases/TROXSavara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA)Class Period: March 7, 2024 to May 23, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; and (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital.Plaintiff alleges that on May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release \"announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file (\"RTF\")] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].\" Specifically, Savara revealed that \"[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).\" On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025.For more information on the Savara lawsuit go to:https://bespc.com/cases/SVRAQuantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO)Class Period: November 15, 2024, to August 18, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025According to the lawsuit, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Quantum Corporation improperly recognized revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025; (2) as a result, Quantum Corporation would need to restate its previously filed financial statements for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.For more information on the Quantum lawsuit go to:https://bespc.com/cases/QMCOFly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE)Class Period: July 15, 2025, to August 14, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to the Company's projected revenue outlook and anticipated sales. In truth, Fly-E's optimistic revenue goals and demand for its EV products and services fell short of reality; defendants continually praised Fly-E's brand reputation in the industry, cost reductions and favorable pricing from suppliers as a key component for Fly-E's ability to grow its sales network, while simultaneously minimizing risks associated with its lithium battery, supply chain changes and the regulatory environment and possible demand fluctuations for its E-Bikes and E-Scooters.On August 14, 2025, Fly-E filed with the SEC a form NT 10-Q: Notification of inability to timely file Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The filing revealed a significant 32% decrease in Fly-E's net revenue compared to the same period in 2024. Notably, defendants stated that the primary driver for the revenue decrease was a decline of \"total units sold\" as customers were less inclined to purchase E-Bikes due to an \"increasing number of lithium battery explosion incidents in New York\". Although there was mention of sector wide lithium battery incidents in the 10-K filed on July 15, 2025, none were specific to Fly-E's lithium battery. Further, Defendants reiterated the fact that the EV industry is \"subject to extensive environmental, safety and other laws and regulations, which include products safety and testing, as well as battery safety and disposal.\" On this news, the price of Fly-E's declined dramatically, from a closing market price of $7.76 per share on August 14, 2025, to $1.00 per share on August 15, 2025, a decline of about 87% in the span of just a single day.For more information on the Fly-E lawsuit go to:https://bespc.com/cases/FLYEAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

        "lead": "Tilray Brands has seen a significant stock surge of 300% since July, driven by potential cannabis reform hopes. However, the company faces ongoing financial challenges, including declining cannabis sales and consistent operating losses, making it a highly speculative investment.",
        "text": "Shares of Tilray Brands (TLRY0.62%) have been hot in recent months. Since the start of July, the stock has soared by around 300%. Excitement around possible cannabis reform in the U.S. has investors bullish on the Canadian-based company's potential growth opportunities.The big question is, can this rally continue? With earnings set to come out next week, on Oct. 9, there could soon be another catalyst to look out for. If Tilray shows progress and is able to improve its financials, that may lead to even further gains. But if that isn't the case, then there may be some pullback.Should you take a chance and buy Tilray stock before it releases its upcoming results, or are you better off holding off?Image source: Getty Images.How has Tilray's stock normally performed after earnings?Tilray's business has struggled to grow and stay out of the red over the years, and that's put it in the doghouse with investors. Although it has been surging in recent months, it's still down over 65% in the past five years. It hasn't been a great buy.The bad news is that the company's quarterly earnings numbers don't normally spark a positive rally. In fact, it's not unusual to see a sell-off after its numbers come out.The challenges in a hyper-competitive cannabis market in Canada make it difficult for not only Tilray but othermarijuana producersto do well. Its earnings reports often serve as painful reminders of how the business simply isn't performing up to expectations. Given the stock's recent rally, there's the potential that it makes Tilray's stock vulnerable for yet another steep sell-off this month.Tilray's financials need a lot of workIn July, Tilray wrapped up its most recent fiscal year, for the period ended May 31. Its net revenue totaled $821.3 million, which was an increase of 4% year over year. That may not sound too bad, but consider that its core cannabis business experienced a 9% decline, with that segment's sales falling to $249 million.Over the years, Tilray has expanded into alcohol and wellness products. These have helped diversify its revenue mix and allowed it to grow its top line, making it less dependent on cannabis. Without acquisitions padding its sales, it may have had an even more difficult time in attractinggrowth investors.However, all those acquisitions haven't been paying off on the bottom line. Tilray'soperating losslast year totaled $174.7 million. It was an improvement from the previous year when its loss was a whopping $2.1 billion, but that was largely due toimpairment charges. In short, this is a money-losing business with minimalorganic growth.Tilray's stock isn't worth gambling onCannabis investors have heard for years about how marijuana reform andlegalizationare coming soon in the U.S., and yet, there's been virtually no progress. Even bills to passsafe bankingfor the industry have stalled. I've seen this cycle many times before in the industry, when the hype around reform eventually gives way to the gloom and reality that nothing is on the horizon.Tilray is a highly speculative stock, and it has effectively been a way for investors to bet on whether marijuana reform is likely. When hopes are high, shares of Tilray go up. But when reality comes crashing down, so too does the stock. The company's earnings likely won't be a positive catalyst for the business given its ongoing struggles, and there's a significant risk that it could nosedive afterwards. This is a stock I'd stay far away from today.",

        "text": "Washington, D.C., Oct. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile have dominated America’s internet landscape for decades. But a new presentation featuring bestselling author and tech entrepreneur James Altucher suggests that a major shift is underway.“In short, Starlink is the radical new future of the internet.”Altucher points to Elon Musk’s satellite internet system as a direct challenge to the legacy infrastructure that consumers have long depended on.“For the first time ever, the company has cut out all traditional wireless networks and internet providers… And instead, it beams fast, reliable, unlimited internet through the air… directly to your device, and to the devices of millions of users worldwide.”Consumers Frustrated, Costs RisingAltucher argues that the timing couldn’t be better for disruption. “Did you know that here in America you’re paying more than any other country… for internet service that ranks among the slowest in the world?.”He cites growing frustration with rising costs: “News even came out recently that here in America, Comcast is raising costs of their service at four TIMES the rate of inflation. Does that seem fair to you?”With Musk’s alternative already in place, Altucher believes consumers now have leverage they’ve never had before.“Luckily, thanks to Elon’s innovation, that’s finally becoming a thing of the past.”Global Reach, Everyday UseStarlink’s rollout is no longer hypothetical. Musk’s technology is already reaching millions of users across industries and continents. “It’s being used on almost every cruise ship and plane in the world… It’s being used in the Ukraine conflict, where all other access to internet service has been cut off… It’s even being used in more than 2.6 million households.”The coverage is designed to extend everywhere:“Elon’s satellites are designed to wrap the Earth, forming a network to deliver lightning-fast internet to every inch of the planet.”From rural cabins to major cities, Altucher suggests the implications are clear: “For Consumers Like You and I, Elon’s Starlink Is a Godsend… For the $2.18 Trillion Telecom Industry, It’s Their Worst Nightmare.”Connecting the UnconnectedBeyond disrupting entrenched U.S. providers, Altucher highlights Starlink’s potential to bring service to billions of people worldwide who currently lack access.“There are 2.9 billion people globally who do NOT have any access to the internet, whatsoever. And by connecting these people… it could help unlock an incredible amount of additional economic value.”He frames this as more than just a business story — but a societal turning point. “Because Starlink’s internet comes to you directly from space, it can reach anywhere in the world… no matter how remote it is.”Why the Stakes Are So HighAltucher believes history offers a blueprint for what happens next. “After AOL introduced internet access via dial-up connection… their stock soared a rare, massive 81,844% in about seven years.”He explains that each leap in internet infrastructure has reshaped both daily life and the companies that dominate it.“Whenever the internet takes a huge leap forward… untold amounts of wealth are made over time by folks who see it coming.”While Altucher avoids predicting exact outcomes, his message is clear: Starlink is positioned to redefine the internet — and leave Big Telecom behind.About James AltucherJames Altucher is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, hedge fund manager, and venture capitalist. He has been “recognized as one of the best venture capitalists, angel investors, and tech entrepreneurs in the world.”Altucher has a long history of identifying transformative shifts early. In 2013, he declared that Bitcoin was the future… when it traded at just $114.” He also predicted Facebook would be worth $100 billion when it was still just a small startup. Today, more than 150,000 readers follow his work through Altucher’s Investment Network.",

        "title": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now -- Including Chevron  ( CVX )  and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF  ( VOO ) ",
        "lead": "Buffett's 60-year-plus investing track record is hard to beat.",
        "text": "I've often warned people not to blindly copy anyone else's investing moves, and I stick by that advice, as each of us has different investing goals, timelines, risk tolerances, and so on. It's not crazy, however, to at least look at what some smart investors are buying (or selling) to see if any companies pique your interest. If they do, you can dig deeper and then make your own investment decision.A particularly good investor to look at would beWarren Buffett, who increased the value of shares of his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A0.70%) (BRK.B0.68%) by an average annual rate of 19.8% over some 60 years. (If you're not amazed, consider that over those same 60 years, the S&P 500 index averaged annual gains of just 10.2%.)Image source: The Motley Fool.Whether you have $1,000 or $100,000 to invest, here are four Berkshire Hathaway stocks for you to consider. Note that each is not necessarily a Buffett pick, as he does have two investing lieutenants in Ted Weschler and Todd Combs -- and Buffett himself is 95 now.1. ChevronEnergy titan Chevron (CVX0.17%) is Berkshire's fifth-largest stock holding, and Berkshire now owns nearly 7% of it. It's a stellardividend-paying stock, with a recent generous 4.3%dividend yield. It's also been a bigstock repurchaser, with its reduced share count leaving each remaining share more valuable. (When you add its dividend payments and share repurchases, its total yield for shareholders was recently 9.1%.)What's so compelling aboutChevron? Well, it's acash-generating machine, for starters, which is a good thing if you're in it for the dividend payments. (It's been increasing its payouts by an annual average of about 6.5% over the past five years, by the way, and has upped its dividends for 38 consecutive years.)It's alsoa low-cost operation, able to wring more profit per barrel of oil than most or all of its peers. Chevron has solid growth prospects, too. Itsacquisition of Hessshould boost its cash flow, and a project in Kazakhstan appears promising, too. Additionally, Chevon has invested in alternative energies.Its recentforward-looking, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 16.5 is above its five-year average of 13.2, suggesting that the stock is not undervalued. So if this stock interests you, you should ideally be planning to hold it for many years.2. Occidental PetroleumOccidental Petroleum (OXY1.42%) is another Berkshire holding, and Berkshire recently owned 27% of the company. Occidental is one of America's largest independent oil and gas producers, and its chemical business, OxyChem, is working to reduce emissions. (Berkshire is actually in talks to acquire OxyChem -- for $10 billion.)The company'sprospects are promisingfor a variety of reasons. For one thing, withUkraine attacking Russian oil plants, rising oil prices can provide a tailwind. Even without that, Occidental has major assets in the Permian Basin, which is a low-cost region in which to produce energy. Occidental has been carrying a lot of debt due to acquisitions, but it's beenpaying its debt down effectively.Like Chevron, Occidental is an energy company and dividend payer, but its recent yield was just 2%. Still, Occidental has been getting its groove back andmay grow faster than Chevronin the near future.3. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETFI'm considering the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO0.01%), a Buffett stock, for a particular reason: Berkshire may not own much of thisS&P 500 index fund, butBuffett has heartily recommended it-- for his wife and the rest of us. It's technically not a stock. It's anexchange-traded fund (ETF)-- a fund that trades like a stock.In case you don't know, theS&P 500is an index of 500 of America's biggest companies, from Apple to Zoetis (a leading animal health company). Together, these 500 companies account for about 80% of the total value of the U.S. stock market. The S&P 500 has a solid, long-term performance record, too, averagingannual returns of close to 10%over long periods, and it even offers a small, but growing dividend.For many, investing in a low-fee S&P 500 index fund can be all you need to build wealth over decades.4. Berkshire HathawayI'd be remiss if I didn't mention the possibility of investing in Berkshire Hathaway itself, because you can do that, and by doing so, you'll be along for the ride, profiting from all its investments.Berkshire has been an amazing stock performer in recent decades, but we should expect somewhat slower growth going forward. It will still grow, though, and the company has been built to last, encompassing scores of wholly owned subsidiaries (such as GEICO and the BNSF railroad) and lots of stocks, too. (It owns more than 21% of American Express, for example, 37% of Sirius XM Holdings, and 9% of Coca-Cola.)Consider some or all of these stocks for berths in your portfolio. Whether you have $1,000 or $100,000, you might spread it across several of these -- or perhaps just stick with an S&P 500 index fund and/or shares of Berkshire.",

As alleged in a recently filed federal securities fraud class action complaint, Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE: ELV), through certain of its officers, represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. In fact, sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs. This increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. As a result, the Complaint alleges Defendants’ positive statements concerning Elevance’s close monitoring of the redeterminations, the actuarial soundness of its rates and the prudence of its forecasts were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Elevance Health Inc.

        "lead": "Rivian faces potential demand challenges in 2026 due to the elimination of federal EV tax credits, which could depress sales and make their vehicles less affordable. The company plans to launch its R2 model at around $45,000, potentially mitigating some market challenges.",
        "text": "Rivian (RIVN0.85%) should have an exciting year ahead. Recently, hundreds of R2s -- Rivian's newest model -- were seen driving the streets of the U.S. Official production should begin in early 2026, giving buyers their first chance to buy a Rivian priced under $50,000.When Tesla introduced its first affordable models -- the Model Y and Model 3 -- sales growth accelerated swiftly in the years that followed. But Tesla was able to take advantage of a key government subsidy that was just eliminated.Rivian will suffer in 2026 without this key subsidy\"Next year could be a pretty dreadful year for EVs in this country,\" predicts Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. Many EV buyers accelerated their planned purchases in order to take delivery before federaltax creditswere eliminated last month. By doing so, they effectively reduced their purchase price by up to $7,500.Naturally, this should depress demand in the final months of 2025, as well as parts of 2026, as buyers that would have purchased during those months have already done so, creating a demand overhang that may take many quarters to fully normalize.Image source: Getty ImagesApart from this, future demand should also be lower. EV buyers are increasingly cost conscious. With EVs now effectively costing up to $7,500 more, expect demand to be more subdued than anticipated. That's especially true for Rivian given it expects to begin production of a low-cost SUV early next year: the Rivian R2. This vehicle is expected to be priced at around $45,000. It likely would have qualified for federal tax credits.Rivian arguably won't suffer as much as otherEV stockslike Lucid Group considering it will at least have a more affordable model on the market. But Lucid's vehicles largely didn't qualify for federal tax credits apart from a lease loophole. Regardless, Rivian now faces a more difficult 2026 without these tax credits.",

        "lead": "The AI revolution is driving massive demand for silver in nuclear reactors, solar panels, and electric vehicles, creating significant opportunities for silver mining companies like First Majestic Silver.",
        "text": "Chances are that you've heard how the real fortunes from the California gold rush weren't made digging for gold. Instead, they were made by people selling picks and shovels. Today, a similar picks-and-shovels opportunity may be shaping up for the $15.7 trillionartificial intelligence(AI) revolution.Because just as the picks and shovels merchants made money no matter who found the gold, First Majestic Silver (AG0.41%), already up 100% in recent months, could keep rising, no matter which tech company wins the AI race.The AI revolution can't proceed without silverAI data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan -- a nation of 125 million people -- by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. This is why OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2024 called for an energy breakthrough to meet the surge in demand, while doubling down in June that a \"significant fraction\" of global electricity should be devoted to AI.And with governments around the world bent on decarbonization, these energy needs will largely be met bynuclear powerand renewables.In America, President Donald Trump is quadrupling the number of nuclear reactors. Worldwide, the number of solar installations soared by 64% for the first half of 2025, compared to the first six months of last year. And despite the loss of tax credits for American buyers, BloombergNEF expects almost 22 million electric vehicles to be sold in 2025, a new record.The turn toclean energyto meet AI's energy needs is a massive boon tosilverprices. That's because the average nuclear reactor needs 56,000 ounces of silver, while each solar panel requires about 0.64 ounces. Electric vehicles need about 1.3 ounces of silver, twice as much as the gas-powered cars they're replacing.Add up the hundreds of millions of solar panels, hundreds of new nuclear reactors, and millions of new electric cars, and it's small wonder that silver prices have surged 60% year to date. And with experts forecasting a supply crunch, it's easy to envision prices climbing still higher.You can see the AI revolution's impact on silver through the iShares Silver Trust (SLV2.33%), a fund that buys and stores physical silver. It's returned over 100% since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.Management touts First Majestic's \"best quarter ever\"The silver boom is great news for First Majestic, which is just coming off what CEO Keith Neumeyer calls its \"best quarter ever in the company's history,\" with a 76% jump in silver production year over year, and a 94% jump in revenue.He also touted the company's record cash flow of $115 million and its total cash of $510 million, calling it \"not too bad a place to be.\" This war chest, against debt of just $235 million, gives First Majestic adebt-to-equity ratioof just 8.08%, which compares favorably to bigger rivals like Pan American Silver (PAAS-0.31%) or Hecla Mining (HL-1.41%), with their respective debt-to-equity ratios of 16.9% and 24.9%.The Vancouver-based company, valued at roughly $6 billion, is still a mid-cap stock. It has four major silver and gold mines, most notably San Dimas, a mine in Durango, Mexico, which recently saw encouraging exploration results. San Dimas has over 30 million ounces of silver in proven and probable reserves, plus 364,000 ounces of gold in proven and probable reserves, which it costs just $21.06 per ounce to extract. First Majestic can access the 10.5 million ounces of proven and probable silver reserves in its Santa Elena mine even more cheaply, at $14.40 per ounce.Image source: Getty Images.But First Majestic isn't content to rest on its laurels. Record spending on exploration is underway, with 255,000 meters expected to be drilled in 2025, compared to 182,909 meters drilled last year.Clearly, management knows what the ongoing silver boom could mean for the company, and is determined to meet the moment.And because 55% of First Majestic's revenue comes from silver, compared to 44% for the nearest major miner, it is a compelling opportunity for investors seeking a \"pure play\" to ride the silver boom.Can shares keep climbing?First Majestic shares have soared over 120% year to date, raising questions of whether its rally can continue.At first glance, shares appear richly valued. First Majestic'sprice-to-sales ratioof 5.7 is well above the industry average of 2.9. Itsforward price-to-earnings ratiostands at 45.3, which is expensive but not prohibitively so.But investors should keep First Majestic's record cash position in mind. Its $510 million in total cash could allow it to make strategic acquisitions to dramatically grow its mining empire, as it did when it acquired the Los Gatos mine and its 6 million ounces in annual silver production in 2024.Additionally, a further climb in silver prices would boost First Majestic's earnings and allow it to grow into its valuation.For investors looking for a way outside of tech to play the global AI revolution, or simply capitalize on an ongoing silver boom, First Majestic could be worth buying.",

        "lead": "Tesla reported a 29% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q3 deliveries, reaching 497,099 vehicles, driven by consumers rushing to purchase before a $7,500 clean-vehicle credit expired. While the surge is impressive, Q4 might see a slowdown, with long-term growth potential tied to more affordable models and autonomous driving technology.",
        "text": "Tesla (TSLA-1.41%) investors have been hoping for a return to growth, and theelectric-car maker delivered. Third-quarter deliveries were 29% higher than the previous quarter and returned to year-over-year growth. These record quarterly deliveries followed two periods of underwhelming sales in the first half of the year.The timing of a blowout quarter wasn't random. U.S. buyers were racing to complete purchases before the $7,500 clean-vehicle credit ended for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, andTesla's refreshed Model Y helped convert interest into orders. The result was a headline-grabbing surge in the deliveries that refocused attention on the company's growth story.But can momentum persist in Q4? The next few months will tell us how much of Q3's strength reflected one-time incentives and how much represented underlying demand that can carry into next year.Image source: Getty Images.An impressive third quarterTesla's third-quarter deliveries came in at 497,099, the company said on Thursday. This is up 7% year over year and far higher than Q2 numbers. Production, however, lagged behind, coming in at 447,450 units. That gap reduced inventory and suggests the company's demand exceeded production -- a testament to the company's compelling lineup and a rush to buy vehicles before the $7,500 credit expired.The surging demand to take advantage of the credit makes perfect sense. Under recently updated IRS guidance, vehicles placed in service after Sept. 30 must have been acquired on or before Sept. 30 to qualify -- meaning shoppers who hadn't locked in by that date lost access to the $7,500 credit. That deadline, therefore, likely concentrated a meaningful number of U.S. deliveries into late September.Product updates likely helped, too. The \"Juniper\" refresh of Model Y rolled out in China in January and reached the U.S., Canada, and Europe weeks later, bringing exterior and interior updates that could have nudged fence-sitters to act. For a vehicle that already represents the bulk of Tesla's volume, even modest improvements can move the needle -- particularly when stacked on top of a closing incentive window.Q4 could be weak, but that's OKInvestors shouldn't assume Q3's pace will continue -- at least not in Q4. With the federal credit no longer available for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, the most obvious catalyst that pulled buyers forward is gone. Add the production-delivery gap from Q3, and it's reasonable to expect a sequential step-down in fourth-quarter deliveries as production and orders realign.The long-term picture, however, remains the more important lens. In Tesla's second-quarter update, management said that \"first builds of a more affordable model\" occurred in June, with volume production planned for the back half of 2025 (so, any day now). The more affordable model, which is rumored to just be a lower-priced Model Y variant, would widen the company's addressable market and could help drive sales higher next year.Additionally, Tesla's progress with its autonomous ride-sharing network, Robotaxi, could attract attention to its cars and bolster demand, since all Tesla vehicles are built with self-driving capabilities. As of now, the self-driving technology requires supervision from the driver, but as it gets closer to full autonomy with future software updates, it will likely get more attention from consumers and may morph into a substantial catalyst for sales over time.The market certainly seems to be looking past a potentially weak Q4. As of this writing, Tesla'smarket capitalizationsits around $1.45 trillion against trailing-12-monthnet incomeof about $5.9 billion, giving the stock an extraordinarily highprice-to-earnings ratioof about 245. While the valuation leaves little room for error, it could prove to be reasonable over the long haul if deliveries reaccelerate alongside growth in software sales and its energy business.Ultimately, despite an impressive third quarter, Q4 may step back as the rush fades and production catches up, which is worth keeping in mind at today's valuation. The more consequential factors, however, are still ahead: lower-priced vehicles and early autonomy efforts. These growth initiatives could put deliveries and revenue on a firmer upward path next year. For investors, the case rests less on one quarter and more on the trajectory those catalysts can sustain over time.",

        "title": "Should Investors Buy Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Before Earnings?",
        "lead": "Its chips are in high demand, though the stock is at an all-time high.",
        "text": "Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (TSM1.50%) will release earnings for the third quarter of 2025 on Oct. 16. The company produces the majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors. Since many of the advancements inartificial intelligence(AI) are not possible without its manufacturing capabilities, the stock is likely to remain a market beater over the long term.Nonetheless, TSMC stock is at an all-time high, and anticipated growth is often not enough of a reason to buy a stock. With an earnings report looming, should investors buy shares of the stock now or stay on the sidelines and hold out for a lower price?The bull case in TSMC stockAs previously mentioned, TSMC faces a few threats to its long-term bull case. It is the world's largest semiconductor foundry company, and as of the second quarter of 2025, its market share now exceeds 70%, according to TrendForce. This is up from 67% in the previous quarter.Additionally, Grand View Research forecasts acompound annual growth rate(CAGR) for AI of 32% through 2033. These combined factors make it highly likely that TSMC's rapid growth will continue.For now, it has exceeded that growth rate, and that rapid growth is on track to continue. In the first half of 2025,revenueincreased by 40% to $56 billion compared to the same period the previous year. It also stated on its Q2 earnings call that it expects between $31.8 billion and $33 billion in revenue during Q3, representing a 38% rise at the midpoint.Investors should note that the company beat revenue estimates in each of the previous four reports. Thus, if it beats estimates like it has in previous quarters, the 40% revenue growth rate from the first two quarters of the year could continue into Q3.Moreover, investors should watch for sales of the most advanced chips, namely those in the 2nm – 5nm size range that power the most advanced AI functions. This is the area where TSMC stands out above competing foundries, since Samsung is the only other chip producer that can manufacture these smaller chips.Areas of dangerAdditionally, even if it is likely to beat earnings estimates, TSMC faces significant challenges.One is simply keeping up with demand. It allocated almost $20 billion tocapital expenditures(CapEx) in the first half of the year, and much of that will go to foundries in Arizona, where it plans to allocate $165 billion to building six advanced manufacturing facilities. Even though that is a considerable sum, it will likely have to maintain or increase that spending to match demand.Another factor is that the majority of production takes place in Taiwan, which faces considerable geopolitical tensions because of its proximity to China. Investors differ on the danger level, as China can probably not afford to have the supply of chips disrupted by geopolitical events.Still, investors should also remember that Warren Buffett forced Berkshire Hathaway to sell its TSMC stake for this reason. Hence, investors must remain aware of this concern.That issue may also be the reason for TSMC's relatively low valuation. It has traded at an averageP/E ratioof 25 over the last five years, far below its key clients such as Apple and Nvidia.Also, while its current 33 P/E ratio is low for a company with 40% revenue growth, the earnings multiple has rarely exceeded 40 in recent years. That could increase the danger of paying a relative premium for TSMC.Should investors buy TSMC stock before earnings?Under current conditions, no obvious factor is pushing investors to either delay or accelerate purchase decisions before the earnings report.Indeed, nobody knows how TSMC stock will react once the company releases Q3 earnings. Still, some risk-averse investors may feel apprehensive about the report amid the rising P/E ratio.If that is the case, one strategy is to do both, allocate half of one's funds to this stock now and wait for the report to spend the additional half. Shareholders who dollar-cost-average into this stock are likely already employing this strategy, and with this near-term outcome unknown, that approach could also work for other investors.Ultimately, barring the aforementioned geopolitical risks, TSMC stock should remain on a bull trend as it struggles to meet the demand for AI chips. For this reason, time in TSMC is almost certainly more critical to winning with the stock than the timing of one's purchase decisions.",

        "text": "New York, United States, Oct. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Due to their inability to attract sufficient investment assets, the Board of Trustees of the Direxion Shares ETF Trust has decided to liquidate and close three ETFs (each, a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”), based on the recommendation of the Funds’ adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC. The Board concluded that liquidating and closing the Funds would be in the best interest of the Funds and their shareholders. The Funds closing are as follows:Fund Summary:Direxion Work From Home ETF (Ticker: WFH, CUSIP: 25460G773)Direxion Daily Electric and Autonomous Vehicles Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: EVAV, CUSIP: 25460G146)Direxion Daily MSCI Emerging Markets ex China Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: XXCH, CUSIP: 25461A684)The Funds will cease trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE”) and will be closed to purchase by investors as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on October 23, 2025 (the “Closing Date”). The Funds will not accept purchase orders after the Closing Date.Shareholders may sell their holdings in a Fund prior to the Closing Date and customary brokerage charges may apply to these transactions. However, from October 23, 2025 through October 30, 2025 (the “Liquidation Date”) shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for a Fund’s shares during this time period. Between the Closing Date and the Liquidation Date, each Fund will be in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio. This process will result in a Fund increasing its cash holdings and, as a consequence, not tracking its underlying index, which is inconsistent with each Fund’s investment objective and strategy.On or about the Liquidation Date, each Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to all shareholders who have not previously redeemed or sold their shares. These distributions are taxable events. In addition, these payments to shareholders may include accrued capital gains and dividends. As calculated on the Liquidation Date, each Fund’s net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the Fund. Once the distributions are complete, the Funds will terminate.About Direxion:Direxion equips investors who are driven by conviction with ETF solutions built for purpose and fine-tuned for precision.

The ETFs are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration that results from an ETF’s investments in a particular industry, sector or company, which can increase volatility. The leveraged and inverse ETF utilize derivatives, such as futures contracts and swaps which are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The leveraged and inverse ETFs do not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns which are a multiple of the return of their respective index or underlying security for periods other than a single day. The leveraged and inverse ETFs may also subject to leverage, correlation, daily compounding, market volatility and risks specific to an industry, sector or company. The non-leveraged ETFs are subject to certain risks, including imperfect index correlation and market price variance, which may decrease performance. The non-leveraged ETFs may invest in a relatively small number of issuers and, as a result, be subject to greater risk of loss with respect to its portfolio securities. The non-leveraged ETFs may experience greater fluctuation in its net asset value as compared to other investments. The non-leveraged ETFs may be appropriate for investors with a long-term investment time horizon, who primarily seek capital growth, and who are able to tolerate periods of prolonged price declines. Please read each ETF’s prospectus for a more complete description of the investment risks. There is no guarantee that an ETF will achieve its investment objective.Distributor: ALPS Distributors, Inc.",

        "title": "My 3 Favorite Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "lead": "The article discusses three stocks with potential investment opportunities: Amazon facing cloud computing challenges, Twilio leveraging AI for customer service, and DraftKings maintaining strong market position despite competitive pressures.",
        "text": "Everybody has their favorite publicly traded companies, me included. My favorites, however, aren't necessarily always the names behind my best stock-buying ideas.Which tickers I step into largely depends on their price, valuation, and growth prospects at the time. Since these factors regularly change for every organization, so, too, does my list of buy-worthy stocks.With that in mind, here's a closer look at three of my favorite stocks to buy right now, as you can step in at a discounted price.AmazonThere's arguably never really a bad time to buy Amazon (AMZN-1.34%). The company is the dominant name in U.S.e-commerce, as well as the biggest name in the global cloud computing market.It has also been willing and able to evolve its assets and business model -- a wise approach. For instance, in addition to entering (and arguably creating) the publiccloud computingindustry by launching Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, it's now leveraging its online shopping website as an advertising medium as much as it is an e-commerce platform. The company has done $61 billion in ad business over the past four quarters, versus companywide annual revenue around $700 billion.So, why are Amazon shares underperforming this year, and down more than 8% since September's high, when most other stocks are up for the same time frame?It's due to AWS, mostly. Although Amazon's cloud computing division remains a growing cash cow, its progress is suffering a margin-crimpling slowdown driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that rivals like Microsoft and Alphabet's Google don't seem to be experiencing to the same degree.Just don't give up on Amazon yet. It's maneuvering to rekindle AI-driven growth for AWS.Although it will take a few quarters to make a measurable difference to its cloud segment's top and bottom lines, Amazon's development of an AI-powered chatbot called Nova is showing promise as a business-building tool.And the company's business relationship with AI outfit Anthropic is gaining traction while highlighting the power of its home-grown Trainium processor that it hopes will compete with Nvidia's AI chips. This effort will also take some time to prove itself, but there's certainly good reason to expect big things.In the meantime, remember that AWS' apparent weakness isn't actually rooted in weak orders; it's a reflection of Amazon's struggle to add capacity fast enough to meet soaring demand. That's a pretty nice problem to have. The cloud segment reported a business backlog of $195 billion as of the second quarter, up 25% from year-earlier levels.The point is: You just have to be patient.TwilioIn retrospect, Twilio (TWLO-2.44%) was one of the market's earliest majorAIbusinesses. But nobody fully appreciated that its tech was a kind of AI when the company was launched in 2008.Twilio helps companies ranging from banks to restaurants to retailers automate their communications with customers, whether by text messages, voice phone calls, online chats, or other means. It automates what was previously (inefficiently) handled by humans.The advent of modern AI takes this technology to a whole new level. Now, Twilio's solutions include fully automated customer service, customer-specific predictions, and even customer-identity authentication.Image source: Getty Images.The only problem is that although Twilio's services were difficult to replicate in the company's early days, the advent of user-friendly AI has now made it much easier to do so. That's the chief reason this company's stock hasn't made any real progress since late last year and remains well below its pandemic-prompted peak, whenconsumerswere suddenly doing a great deal more online or by phone.In the bigger picture, last year's tepid organic revenue growth of only 9% underscores this competitive headwind, but Twilio's sales growth for the second quarter of this year has reaccelerated to a pace of 13%, easily topping the company's full-year guidance for organic top-line growth of only 8%.So that guidance may be understating what actually awaits now that the company has newer and better AI solutions. The analyst community thinks so anyway. Twilio -- now on track to report per-share earnings of $4.55 this year and $5.21 per share for 2025 -- isbargain-priced at less than 20 timesnext year's expected profits. The stock is also trading nearly 30% below the analysts' current consensus price target of $130.76.DraftKingsLastly, add DraftKings (DKNG1.26%) to your list of investment prospects following the stock'ssizable 11.6% setback on Tuesday. That stumble isn't likely to turn into anything more serious, though.The reason for the sell-off makes enough superficial sense. The website Kalshi reported record-breaking wagering on Saturday. And it then broke that record the next day.Most of this swell of wagering stemmed from bets on Saturday's college football games followed by Sunday's pro games, so the market understandably viewed Kalshi's growing reach as a threat to more-conventional sport betting platforms like DraftKings and Flutter's FanDuel. And at least some sports fans will opt for Kalshi's offering rather than DraftKings.But seeing Kalshi as a serious long-term threat to sports-focused sites ignores DraftKings' (not to mention FanDuel's) long-established history as asports bettingservice.First launched as a fantasy sports website in 2012, DraftKings began adding sports-based wagering when the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the federal ban on it in 2018. As of the second quarter of this year, the company operates a conventional online sportsbook in 28 states, with more on the way.Meanwhile, most U.S. states now permit DraftKings to operate its \"daily\" fantasy sports business, which dishes out prize money to fans who successfully create a new winning fantasy sports team every single day, not unlike Kalshi's offering.The difference is that Kalshi is still mostly a sociocultural wagering platform allowing individuals to make bets on things like election results, economic data, and which of Taylor Swift's newest songs will be streamed most often. Sure, it also offers sports wagering, but the weekend's sport-based betting surge doesn't feel like the new norm for Kalshi.It feels like an exception to the norm that will ultimately give way to specialized players like DraftKings, which is still expected to report 33.5% revenue growth this year, pushing profits sharply higher as a result. Next year's growth is projected to be just as impressive.This might help: Prior to Kalshi's recent head-turning news, 28 of the 37 analysts following DraftKings considered the stock a strong buy, with a consensus target of $54.55 that's more than 40% above the stock's present price. It's unlikely that one good weekend from a rival changed this consensus that much.",

        "title": "Why's Everyone Talking About Costco Stock?",
        "lead": "Costco stands out as a unique retailer with a member-first business model, generating significant revenue from membership fees and maintaining high customer loyalty. The company shows strong potential for international expansion and consistent growth, trading at a premium valuation that reflects its robust business strategy.",
        "text": "Costco Wholesale (COST-0.10%) doesn't grab headlines the way tech giants do, yet it's quietly become one of the most talked-about companies in the market.The stock trades near all-time highs and sits at a premium valuation, which naturally raises eyebrows. However, beneath the surface, Costco continues to deliver the kind of steady growth and loyalty that investors prize.This article will focus on three reasons investors are keeping a close eye on the company: its customer-firstbusiness model, its long runway for growth, and the question of whether today's valuation leaves enough upside.Image source: Getty Images.1. Keeping users at the center of its business modelCostco is not a typical retailer. It has built its identity around members, not margins. The bulk of its profit doesn't come from selling products, it comes from membership fees. In fiscal 2025 (year ended Aug. 31, 2025), those fees generated $5.3 billion inrevenue, representing the bulk of Costco'snet incomeof $8.1 billion.That's only possible because members stay loyal. Renewal rates exceed 90% in the U.S. and are close to that mark worldwide. Members keep coming back because they know Costco will pass savings on to them. The company famously operates on razor-thin markups, generally capping prices at a gross margin of around 14% to 15%, which is far below that of many competitors.The result is a retail ecosystem that reinforces itself. Customers feel valued, they renew their membership over time, and Costco reinvests in lower prices. Yet, the membership fees generate billions of bottom-line profits for Costco.It's a virtuous cycle that resembles a subscription platform more than a traditional retailer. Few retailers have managed to keep users firmly at the center of their model -- and it's the reason Costco has been able to compound its success steadily through decades of market shifts.2. The giant still has plenty of room for growthWith 914 warehouses worldwide, Costco still has significant white space ahead of it. Roughly two-thirds of those locations are in the U.S., leaving international markets as the next chapter. The company typically opens 20 to 30 new warehouses annually -- not flashy, but relentless.International stores have shown encouraging signs. In China, for instance, early openings drew huge crowds, reflecting strong demand for Costco's model in new markets. If Costco can replicate even a fraction of its North American success abroad, the growth runway extends well into the next decade.And expansion isn't just about physical warehouses. Costco has been investing ine-commerceand digital services, making it easier for members to shop online while still leveraging its buying power andlow-costethos. With the growing role of Kirkland Signature, its private-label brand, Costco's long-term growth levers appear both diverse and durable.For investors, this means Costco is not just coasting on a mature U.S. business -- it's quietly building global scale and widening itsmoatin the process.3. A word on valuationThis is where the debate gets interesting. Costco currently trades at around 52 times earnings, a steep premium to its historical multiples and its peers. Investors are effectively paying up for certainty, which includes predictable recurring income, loyal members, and a long runway for expansion.That doesn't mean the stock is a bargain. Periods of multiple compression are possible, especially if consumer spending weakens or international growth takes longer to scale. Higher interest rates could also pressure premium multiples across defensive sectors.But for long-term investors, valuation alone rarely defines the Costco story. The company has earned its premium by delivering consistent growth across cycles, and its recurring membership base provides a cushion few retailers can match. The question is not whether Costco is \"cheap\" today, but instead whether it will continue to grow a decade from now.What does it mean for investors?Costco has become a market favorite because it combines three rare traits: a member-first model that generates sticky recurring revenue, a proven track record of long-term execution, and long-term expansion potential.Given the optimism, it is not surprising that the stock trades at a premium. But for long-term investors willing to hold through cycles, Costco remains one of the most interesting compounding stories in retail. That's why everyone is talking about Costco stock today -- and why they probably still will be a decade from now.",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks Perfect for Gen Xers to Add to Their Portfolios",
        "lead": "A Motley Fool analyst recommends three tech stocks for Gen X investors: Meta Platforms, ASML, and CrowdStrike, highlighting their growth potential, market positioning, and future prospects in technology and digital sectors.",
        "text": "The stock market is often considered the world's greatest wealth creator, but somerecent datacompiled by The Motley Fool reveals that many Americans are still missing out on those life-changing gains. According to a recent Gallup poll, only 62% of American adults owned stocks. The Federal Reserve also found that baby boomers held 54% of all shares in the U.S., while Gen Xers and Millennials only held 21.9% and 8.5%, respectively.Those lopsided percentages could be bad news for the Gen Xers, who are already 45 to 60 years old. But if you're a Gen Xer who has at least a decade left before retirement, you might want to invest in a few high-growth tech companies that have wide moats, robust growth rates, and clear plans for the future.So today, let's take a look at three stocks which I (as a 45-year-old Gen Xer) either personally own or would be comfortable buying in this frothy market: Meta Platforms (META-2.29%), ASML (ASML0.17%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD-1.40%).1. Meta PlatformsMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, is the world's top social media company with 3.48 billion monthly active users across all its apps. It generates most of its revenue by crafting targeted ads for those users, and it shares a near-duopoly in digital ads with Alphabet's Google.Meta has been upgrading its ownAI algorithmsto craft better targeted ads from its own first-party data to reduce its dependence on third-party data. It's been expanding Reels to keep up with TikTok in the short video space, and it's been subsidizing the expansion of its unprofitable Reality Labs segment (which develops its loss-leading virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) products) with its higher-margin advertising revenue.From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 16% and 13%, respectively. That growth should be driven by the ongoing expansion of its user base, the increased efficiency of its AI-powered ads, and the gradual growth of its AR and VR businesses. Its stock also looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings -- so it could still have plenty of room to run over the next few years.2. ASMLASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. All of the world's largest chip foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- use its systems to manufacture their chips. ASML is also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems, which are required to produce the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.ASML's monopolization of that crucial technology makes it a bellwether of thesemiconductor industryand gives it nearly unlimited pricing power. Its latest \"high-NA\" EUV systems, which cost about $400 million and require multiple planes to ship, will allow those foundries to manufacture even smaller chips beyond the 2nm node (which currently covers the world's densest chips) over the next few years.From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect ASML's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 10% and 17%, respectively. That growth should be supported by the rollout of its high-NA EUV systems, its consistent sales of its \"low-NA\" EUV systems, as well as the stable sales of its older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems for more mature nodes. Its stock might seem a bit pricey at 33 times next year's earnings, but its dominance of the lithography market justifies that higher multiple.3. CrowdStrikeCrowdStrike is one of the world's largest cybersecurity companies. But unlike many of its peers, which install on-site appliances to run their services, CrowdStrike only provides its Falcon endpoint security platform as acloud-basedservice. That approach is easier to scale, doesn't require on-site maintenance, and locks its clients into its sticky subscriptions.CrowdStrike already serves 300 of the Fortune 500 companies, so its disruptive strategy is clearly impressing a lot of big customers. It initially gives each customer access to four cloud-based modules, which serve as a foundation to cross-sell additional modules to increase the stickiness of its ecosystem and boost its revenues per customer. In its latest quarter, some 48% of its customers were using at least six of those cloud-based modules.From fiscal 2025 (which ended this January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a CAGR of 22% and 28%, respectively. They also expect it to turn profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in fiscal 2027 and more than double its net income in fiscal 2028. Its stock might not seem like a bargain at 70 times next year's adjusted EBITDA right now, but it should continue to thrive through economic downturns because companies generally won't lower their digital defenses just to save a few dollars.",

        "lead": "The article compares Chevron and Enterprise Products Partners as energy investment options, highlighting their different business models, dividend yields, and risk profiles for investors seeking energy sector exposure.",
        "text": "Energy is one of the most important things in the world. Spend one day without power of any kind and you quickly realize that you might as well be living in the Stone Age. Most investors should have some exposure to energy, including the highly volatile oil and natural gas sector. But what's the best way to include it in your portfolio?Chevron (CVX0.17%) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD0.76%) are top-notch choices. They both offer attractive yields, but they are vastly different businesses. Here's how you can pick the one that's right for your income portfolio.Great dividend streaks either way you goBefore going into the different business models here, it is important to examine how reliable each of theseincome stocksreally is. Chevron is a much older company and has a 38-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. Enterprise's streak is 27 years long, which is basically as long as it has existed. Pretty clearly, they stand toe to toe when it comes to income reliability.That said, there's a vast difference when it comes todividend yield. Chevron's yield is 4.3%. Enterprise's distribution yield is 6.9%. This isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, however. Chevron is a traditional corporation, while Enterprise is amaster limited partnership(MLP). The MLP structure is a bit complex and it is specifically designed to pass income on to unitholders in a tax-advantaged fashion. The trade off is more work come tax time, thanks to theK-1 formunitholders have to deal with.If you want to keep your tax life simple, you'll want to avoid MLPs like Enterprise. But if you want to maximize the income your portfolio generates, you'll definitely want to consider MLPs. But the bigger difference between Enterprise and Chevron for most investors is going to show up in how they operate.What do Chevron and Enterprise do?Enterprise Products Partners is what is known as a midstream MLP. It owns energy infrastructure assets that move oil and natural gas around the world, including storage,pipelines, and transportation assets. These are expensive to build (or buy), but they generate reliable fee income. And the fees are paid for the use of the assets, so the price of the oil and natural gas that they move is far less important to Enterprise's financial results than commodity prices.Chevron, by contrast, is an integratedenergy company. That means that it owns assets across the energy landscape, from production (the upstream), through the midstream, and all the way to refining and chemicals (the downstream). The midstream exposure provides some stability, but the upstream and the downstream are both commodity driven.That's a negative and a positive. The upstream is hurt when oil prices are weak, but the downstream uses oil as an input and can actually benefit from low energy prices. The end result is that the integrated model helps to soften, but not eliminate, the revenue and earnings swings that occur because of volatile energy prices. It is a relatively stable way to invest in oil and natural gas, but it still exposes investors to commodity volatility.Which one is right for your portfolio?If you are a risk-averse investor looking to generate as much income as possible from your portfolio, the answer here will be Enterprise Products Partners. It has a higher yield and a more consistent business model.But some investors actually want more direct exposure to energy prices. In that case, Chevron is going to be the winner. Notably, the reliable dividend it pays will make it a better choice for income investors than pure-play energy producers, where oil prices can create massive volatility on theincome statement.",

        "title": "2 Dirt Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Before It's Too Late",
        "lead": "The article highlights two dividend stocks trading at significant discounts: Albemarle, a lithium producer with long-term potential in electric vehicle battery markets, and Constellation Brands, a leading beverage company with a strong Mexican beer portfolio.",
        "text": "Dividend stocksare an incredibly popular option among investors, especially those looking for a steady income or to reinvest dividends to enable thepower of compounding. Generally, these dividend stocks are more stable businesses, financially mature, and are often fairly valued.However, if you can find some that are trading on the cheap and receive not only a dividend but a potentially increasing share price, it's a double benefit! Here are two such stocks, trading on the cheap and offering a dividend.An electrifying stockUnless you spend a lot of time researching the basic materials sector, Albemarle (ALB0.70%) is likely a company you haven't heard of. Albemarle is one of the world's largest lithium producers and operates lithium refining plants in the U.S., Chile, and China. Lithium demand is mostly driven by batteries, where lithium is used as the energy storage material, andelectric vehiclesare a primary source ofdemand.The great long-term news is that the future of the globalautomotive industryis almost certainly electric vehicles, which should drive lithium demand for decades. Not only does Albemarle have top-tier lithium assets, they are among the lowest-cost sources of lithium production on the planet. Further, Albemarle also owns resources in the U.S. and Argentina that are still in the early development phase, enabling a long-term boost for its lithium production volumes in the coming decades.One of the reasons Albemarle is trading at a discount right now is because CATL's lithium mine was temporarily shut down due to expired permits, a development that was expected to last six to 12 months. Instead the shutdown of only one month means the lithium market will likely remain oversupplied in 2025, leaving lithium prices lower.While Albemarle's roughly 2%dividend yieldwon't jump off the page, its discount does. Morningstar rates the company's fair value at $200, meaning it's trading at a roughly 58% discount to fair value. It could be a fantastic opportunity to scoop up what should be a long-term lithium winner while it's on the cheap.All about the beerConstellation Brands (STZ1.20%) is the largest provider of alcoholic beverages in the U.S. across beer, wine, and spirits categories, generating more than 80% of its revenue from Mexican beer imports such as Modelo and Corona. The beverage company also owns a 26% stake in Canopy Growth, which is a medicinal and recreational cannabis producer.Image source: Getty Images.First, the good news. Constellation Brands has a wideeconomic moatthanks to strong brand image and distributor relations from its high-volume Mexican beer portfolio. In fact, it's the big player in the premium import beer segment in the U.S. thanks to its acquisition of exclusive distribution rights for its Mexican beer brands in the U.S. market.Now for the bad news, and why Constellation is trading on the cheap. Right now the company is dealing with softer beer demand, which is expected to continue in the near term due to consumers pulling back on spending. Management also reduced its fiscal 2026 outlook due to softening demand, macroeconomic uncertainty, and higher costs from tariffs.Despite near-term headwinds, the company is well positioned long term with its beer business and upcoming pipeline of innovative products including new flavors, nonalcoholic beers, as well as lower-calorie beers that attract a younger consumer.While investors wait for consumer spending to return to normal Constellation offers a solid 3% dividend yield, an 8.3% total yield when share buybacks are included, and trades at a 41% discount to Morningstar's fair value estimate of $225 per share.Buy now?Both of these companies offer long-term upside in their share price as headwinds fade, as well as solid dividends to provide investors with value while you wait. At these steep discounts it could be a good time for investors to dabble in a starting a small position.",

        "text": "NEW YORK, Oct. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firmBleichmar Fonti & Auld LLPannounces that a lawsuit has been filed against Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.If you invested in Charter, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/charter-communications-inc-class-action-lawsuit.Investors have until October 14, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Charter securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Sandoval v. Charter Communications, Inc., No. 1:25-cv-06747.Why Was Charter Sued Under the Federal Securities Laws?Charter is a leading broadband, or high-speed internet, connectivity company and cable operator. Charter participated in the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”), which provided funding to Charter in exchange for subsidizing high-speed internet plans for low-income households. In June 2024, lack of federal funding caused the ACP to end, which led to customer declines at Charter.During the relevant period, Charter told investors that the Company was executing a plan to minimize and move beyond risks that the end of the ACP had on customer declines and earnings. The Company stated that it had “managed the end of the affordable connectivity program successfully” and that “[t]he impact of the elimination of the ACP is now behind us.” As alleged, in truth, the impact from the ACP’s elimination was not behind Charter as the Company continued to experience internet customer and revenue declines from the program’s end.The Stock Declines as the Truth Is RevealedOn July 25, 2025, Charter announced its second quarter 2025 financial results. The Company reported that total internet customers decreased by 117,000 during the quarter, which included approximately 50,000 disconnects related to the end of the ACP, nearly double from the prior quarter. On this news, the price of Charter stock declined $70.25 per share, or 18.4%, from a closing price of $380.00 per share on July 24, 2025, to $309.75 per share on July 25, 2025.Click here for more information:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/charter-communications-inc-class-action-lawsuit.What Can You Do?If you invested in Charter you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

During the relevant period, the Company touted the strong and sustainable demand for its cars, driven by factors such as a seamless customer experience.In truth, it appears that the announcement of U.S. tariffs imposed on cars provided a short-term boost to demand, as customers purchased cars prior to the tariffs taking effect.The Stock Declines as the Truth Is RevealedOn September 25, 2025, the Company reported earnings for fiscal Q2 2025. For that quarter, CarMax announced sales declines across the board, including a 5.4% decline in retail used unit sales, a 6.3% decline in comparable store used unit sales, and a 2.2% decline in wholesale units. The Company also posted a disappointing Q2 net earnings of about $95.4 million, down from $132.8 million over the prior year.

        "lead": "NASA has effectively reduced support for Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spacecraft after a decade of delays, potentially removing the company from its Commercial Re-Supply mission contract and signaling skepticism about the spacecraft's viability.",
        "text": "\"Sierra Space Corporation.\"It's been a couple of years since I last had an opportunity to write about this space stock.Back in 2023, theprivately held companyraised $290 million in new funds to complete development of its Dream Chaser spacecraft -- and surged ahead to a $5 billion private market valuation, making Sierra Space 5X aunicorn stock.And at long last, Sierra Space is back in the news this week. But not in a good way.Image source: Sierra Space.Playing ketchup in spaceRemember the old Heinz ketchup commercial, the one singing \"an-ti-ci-pation, an-tic-i-pay-yay-shun,\" as the kid waited for his ketchup to pour out of the bottle.Forspace investors, that's what it's felt like waiting for Sierra Space to do something interesting these last several years. It's been nearly a decade since NASA awarded Sierra Space (technically, its parent company Sierra Nevada Corp.) a role in its$14 billion CRS-2 projectto send Commercial Re-Supply spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS).Valued at roughly $628 million per launch, and with Sierra expected to run seven of the launches, the contract felt like a windfall for Sierra Space, which was a surprise winner added to the list of two incumbent CRS-1 providers, SpaceX and Northrop Grumman (known as Orbital ATK at the time).Through 2024, the three companies were hired to launch a total of 18 CRS missions to keep the ISS astronauts well-stocked with supplies. SpaceX would use its Dragon spacecraft for its launches, and Northrop its Cygnus supply vessel. Sierra, the new entrant to the CRS club, was chosen on the strength of the new Dream Chaser spaceplane it was designing, which was expected to start launching in 2019.Problem is, it's 2025 today -- and Dream Chaser hasn't flown even once.Sierra was making NASA waitAnd NASA's patience with Sierra Space has finally worn thin. We had warnings that things were not looking great for Sierra back in 2022, when NASA extended its existing CRS-2 contract from the original 18 launches to 32, running through 2026. In that extension, NASA specifically named SpaceX to conduct 15 of the launches, Northrop 14, and Sierra... only three.Last week, the space agency announced it has decided to \"modify\" the contract even further. And by \"modify\" I mean it's probably going to kick Sierra out of the contract entirely.Admittedly, NASA put it kindlier than that: \"After a thorough evaluation, NASA and Sierra Space have mutually agreed to modify the contract, as the company determined Dream Chaser development is best served by a free flight demonstration, targeted in late 2026.\"That's how NASA phrased its ultimatum -- but the meaning is clear.After 10 years of no Dream Chaser flights, NASA's tired of waiting for Sierra's phantom spacecraft. Now, NASA's telling the company it needs to either prove Dream Chaser can fly, after which NASA might permit it to fly to ISS and pay for the flights -- or else admit Dream Chaser is a mirage and let SpaceX and Northrop handle the work of resupplying the space station. In the meantime, NASA's shutting off the funding spigot to Sierra, promising to provide only \"minimal support through the remainder of the development and the flight demonstration.\"Furthermore, even if Sierra does get Dream Chaser to orbit by next year, \"NASA is no longer obligated [to buy] a specific number of resupply missions,\" and only \"may order Dream Chaser resupply flights to the space station\" (emphasis added -- \"may,\" not \"will\").Time is running out for Sierra Space -- and for a Sierra Space IPOYou can understand NASA's frustration. ISS is due to deorbit in 2030. (NASA's evenpaying Elon Musk $850 million to make it so). If Sierra doesn't get Dream Chaser operational soon, there's not going to be an ISS to deliver supplies to anymore. And in any case, SpaceX and Northrop appear to have the situation well in hand, such that there's not really any need for Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spacecraft to lend a hand.Granted, there's still the possibility Dream Chaser could be used for flights to one or more future private space stations that will eventually replace ISS. That's probably part of the reason (some) investors still hope we will see Sierra Spaceannounce an IPOone day.If NASA is starting to give up on Sierra Space's future, though,maybe investors should, too.",

        "lead": "Costco continues to demonstrate robust financial performance with rising sales, expanding e-commerce, and strong membership growth, particularly among younger customers. The company's high renewal rates and ability to navigate economic challenges make it an attractive long-term investment.",
        "text": "Costco Wholesale (COST-0.10%) is a fan favorite among many shoppers looking for great deals. Investors love the company, too, thanks to its rising sales, expanding earnings, and growth from its e-commerce business.All this has contributed to Costco's share price rising 180% over the past five years -- easily outpacing the S&P 500's return of 99%. While some investors were disappointed with the company's latest quarter, I think they're missing the bigger picture for the company's long-term potential.Here are three reasons the stock is still a great buy.1. Costco's growth is still impressiveSome investors sold theirCostcoshares after the company released its results from Q4, which ended August 31, because the company missed analysts' same-store-sales estimates. I think that reaction was a bit overblown, considering thatsame-store saleswere still up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter and especially since Costco's overall metrics were very impressive.Here's a quick summary of some of Costco's solid Q4 results:Revenue of $86.16 billion, up 8% and ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimate of $86.06 billion.Earnings per share (EPS)of $5.87, an increase of 11%, beating analysts' consensus estimate of $5.80.Membership income rose 14% to $1.7 billion.Costco navigated a potentially difficult quarter as it managed tariffs by offering new items from its Kirkland Signature private-label brand. It also grew its top and bottom lines, along with an impressive spike in membership income. With growth like this amid an uncertain time for retailers, the company showed it can weather difficult macroeconomic conditions and still come out ahead.2. Both e-commerce and physical stores continue expandingSome retailers struggle to find the right balance between expanding their e-commerce businesses and opening new stores -- but not Costco. The company's online sales continue to march higher at the same time that it expands its store footprint.E-commercesales rose by 13.5% in the quarter and now account for about 7% of total sales, and traffic to the company's website jumped 27% in the fourth quarter. On an annual basis, its online sales are even more impressive, rising 15% in fiscal 2025 to $19.6 billion. Part of the increase is likely due to Costco offering more products online, improving search features, and even launching an online waiting room for high-interest items.In addition to its expanding online presence, Costco continues to open new stores including 24 this year, bringing the total to 914 worldwide. A total of nine stores were opened in the fourth quarter alone, and Costco plans to add 30 additional stores in 2026. More stores mean the potential for more members to shop at Costco, which could help drive membership income even higher.3. Younger shoppers, higher earners, and high renewal ratesCostco had made some important gains in expanding its appeal to younger shoppers. Earlier this year, its management highlighted the fact that each year, about half of the customers who sign up for new memberships are under age 40.That's important for the company because people in that age category may have moredisposable incometo spend than older shoppers. What's more, the average Costco customer has an average annual household income of about $125,000, which gives the company a solid base of customers who may be able to continue their spending in uncertain economic times. This is all the more important as recent jobs data shows thehiring market is slowing down.Once younger people sign up for a Costco membership, they're likely to stick around. Costco has very high membership renewal rates of 93% (for its U.S. and Canadian customers), which means that today's new members are likely to remain tomorrow's customers.With Costco's membership-income growth, rising sales and earnings, ability to attract new customers, and high renewal rates, there are a lot of reasons to buy the company's stock and hold onto this retail giant for years to come.",

        "title": "Why IBM Stock Soared 16% in September",
        "lead": "IBM experienced significant stock gains in September, driven by breakthroughs in AI and quantum computing, with notable achievements including $7.5 billion in generative AI business and a quantum computing demonstration with HSBC that improved bond trading predictions.",
        "text": "A tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, along with an apparent breakthrough inquantum computing, helped push IBM (IBM0.65%) stock back to near-record levels in September. IBM stock gained 15.9% last month, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence, largely erasing the losses suffered over the summer.Image source: Getty Images.AI and quantum computingIBM's AI business doesn't generate a lot of headlines, but the company has quietly become a powerhouse in the industry by focusing on enterprise solutions. IBM has booked more than $7.5 billion worth ofgenerative AIbusiness so far. The combination of consulting and software, as well as variousstrategic partnerships with other technology companies, allows IBM to offer complete AI solutions that include integration and implementation services, and that use the third-party cloud platforms that enterprise clients have already embraced.While there hasn't been any meaningful news coming out of IBM's AI business over the past month, the AI industry has seen a frenzy of major developments. OpenAI and Oracle struck an enormous AI computing deal, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, and the Stargate project signed agreements with memory chip manufacturers to supply gargantuan quantities of chips. For IBM, a rising tide lifts all AI boats.Outside of AI, IBM and HSBC announced asignificant breakthrough in the field of quantum computingin September. HSBC used IBM's quantum computers to demonstrate a meaningful improvement over classical computers for a specific computational problem related to bond trading. Quantum computing was paired with classical techniques to deliver a 34% improvement in predicting how likely a trade in the over-the-counter European bond market would be filled at a quoted price.While large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are still years away, IBM is making progress applying the technology to real-world use cases. IBM has already generated around $1 billion in bookings related to quantum computing, but the quantum computing industry could reach $198 billion by 2040, according to estimates from McKinsey.Accelerating growthIBM's AI business is one reason why the company's revenue growth is set to accelerate this year. IBM expects revenue adjusted for currency to grow by at least 5% in 2025. While this may not seem impressive, it's important to remember that IBM is a sprawling company with a mix of legacy businesses and faster-growing businesses.Another factor: Demand for discretionary tech projects is weak, given the state of the economy, which is offsetting some of the company's AI and cloud-driven growth.AI should continue to drive IBM's revenue higher even if the hype around the technology starts to fizzle out. Since IBM focuses on enterprise AI solutions that cut costs or boost efficiency, often withsmall, specialized AI models, the company isn't dependent on frontier models improving dramatically. Beyond the next few years, quantum computing can start to have an impact as IBM pushes forward on its quantum roadmap.With IBM expecting to generate at least $13.5 billion in free cash flow this year, the stock trades at a price-to-free cash flow ratio of about 20. While that's certainly not bargain territory, the company's long-term opportunities in AI and quantum computing justify the valuation.",

        "text": "KONTICH, Belgien, Oct. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Die weltweit angesehene Marke Monroe® hat ein völlig neues, umfassendes Sortiment an Luftfedern für Nutzfahrzeuge vorgestellt, das sich durch eine Reihe technischer Verbesserungen auszeichnet, die durch außergewöhnliche Leistung und längere Lebensdauer zur Erhöhung der Fahrzeugsicherheit und Produktivität beitragen. Diese neuen Luftfedern sind für eine Vielzahl von Lkw, Bussen und anderen Fahrzeugtypen von Mercedes-Benz, IVECO, DAF, Renault Trucks, MAN, Volvo und weiteren Fahrzeugherstellern erhältlich und mit diesen kompatibel.„Luftfedern für Nutzfahrzeuge arbeiten unter extremen Bedingungen, die anwendungsspezifische Konstruktionsverbesserungen, hochwertige Materialien und hohe Fertigungsstandards erfordern. Magnum-Luftfedern von Monroe sind auf langlebige Leistung ausgelegt und tragen dazu bei, die Sicherheit von Fahrzeugen unter schwierigen Bedingungen zu gewährleisten“, so Sylvain Gary, Senior Product Manager, EMEA, DRiV.Die neue Luftfedernreihe Magnum von Monroe baut auf der langjährigen Führungsposition von Monroe als zuverlässiger Erstausrüster für Nutzfahrzeughersteller auf. Durch diese umfassenden Erkenntnisse aus der Erstausrüstung konnten die Ingenieure von Monroe mehrere einzigartige Verbesserungen bei Federdesign und -konstruktion identifizieren und validieren, die zur Maximierung der Leistung und Haltbarkeit im Einsatz beitragen. Dazu gehören:Hochwertige Faltenbälge, hergestellt aus einer präzisen Formel hochwertiger Gummimaterialien, um eine flexible Leistung über eine längere Lebensdauer zu gewährleisten und gleichzeitig Ozon, Schmutz und rauen Wetterbedingungen standzuhalten.Flexibles neues Premium-Stoßfängerdesign, das nachweislich einer Kraft von bis zu 89 Kilonewton (kN) standhält, ohne zu reißen oder zu brechen.Langlebige Kolbenkonstruktionen: Je nach Anwendung verfügen Magnum-Luftfedern von Monroe über ultrahochfeste Stahlkolben, die für Fahrzeuge mit extremer Belastung entwickelt wurden, oder über leichte Kunststoffkolben der nächsten Generation mit einer modernen Korrosionsschutzbeschichtung.Die neue Magnum-Reihe von Monroe umfasst gewundene Luftfedern, die sich ideal für die Achsliftfunktion in mehrachsigen Fahrzeugen sowie für die pneumatische Hebefunktion und Schwingungsisolierung in industriellen Umgebungen eignen; Rollover-Luftfedern, die für verbesserte Seitenstabilität sorgen und so die Kontrolle über das Fahrzeug in Kurven und bei ungleichmäßiger Beladung erleichtern; und komplette Luftfederbaugruppen, die sowohl in langlebiger, leichter Ausführung (Kunststoffkolben) als auch in ultrahochfester Ausführung (Stahlkolben) erhältlich sind. Jede Luftfeder ist so konstruiert, dass sie die korrekte Fahrhöhe und den Schwerpunkt des jeweiligen Fahrzeugs aufrechterhält und so dazu beiträgt, dass die Ladung stabil bleibt und die Fahrer auch auf schwierigen Strecken sicher unterwegs sind.Luftfedern spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Aufrechterhaltung der Fahrzeugsicherheit und Produktivität sowie bei der Senkung der Gesamtwartungskosten für Fahrzeuge. Durch die gleichmäßige und effektive Absorption von Stößen und starken Vibrationen schützen die Federn andere Fahrwerkskomponenten vor vorzeitigem Verschleiß und Ausfall.„Der Ausfall von Luftfedern ist eine der Hauptursachen für Fahrzeugausfälle bei Flotten und anderen Nutzfahrzeugbetreibern“, erklärte Gary. „Händler und Dienstleister können ihren Kunden helfen, vorzeitige Ausfälle und andere kostspielige Probleme zu vermeiden, indem sie Luftfedern anbieten, die auf Zuverlässigkeit und Langlebigkeit ausgelegt sind – und das alles von Monroe, einer Marke, die sie kennen und der sie vertrauen.“Besuchen Siemonroe.com, um mehr über Magnum-Luftfedern und andere erstklassige Produkte von Monroe für Lkw, Anhänger, Busse und Bau-/Geländemaschinen zu erfahren.Über DRiVDRiV, eine Unternehmensgruppe von Tenneco, ist ein führender Anbieter im Automobil-Aftermarket, der sich der Verbesserung der Fahrzeugleistung durch innovative Lösungen und herausragende Technik verschrieben hat.

Ces nouveaux ressorts pneumatiques sont disponibles et conçus pour être compatibles avec une large gamme de camions, bus et autres véhicules de constructeurs tels que Mercedes-Benz, IVECO, DAF, Renault Trucks, MAN, Volvo, et plus encore.« Les ressorts pneumatiques pour véhicules utilitaires fonctionnent dans un environnement difficile qui exige des améliorations de conception spécifiques à l’application, des matériaux de qualité supérieure et des normes de fabrication élevées. Les ressorts pneumatiques Monroe Magnum sont conçus et fabriqués pour offrir des performances durables et contribuer à la sécurité des véhicules dans des conditions difficiles », a déclaré Sylvain Gary, responsable principal des produits, EMEA, DRiV.La nouvelle gamme de ressorts pneumatiques Monroe Magnum s’appuie sur le leadership de longue date de Monroe en tant que fournisseur d’équipement d’origine de confiance pour les constructeurs de véhicules utilitaires. Grâce à cette expertise approfondie, les ingénieurs Monroe ont identifié et validé plusieurs améliorations uniques en matière de conception et de fabrication, destinées à optimiser la performance et la durabilité. Parmi celles-ci :Soufflets premium fabriqués à partir d’une formule précise de matériaux en caoutchouc de haute qualité afin de conserver leur souplesse pendant toute leur durée de vie tout en résistant à l’ozone, à la saleté, aux impuretés de la route et aux conditions météorologiques difficiles.Nouvelle butée flexible haut de gamme testée pour résister à une force pouvant atteindre 89 kilonewtons (kN) sans fissures ni ruptures.Conceptions de pistons durables : selon l’application, les ressorts pneumatiques Monroe Magnum sont équipés de pistons en acier ultra-résistants conçus pour les véhicules soumis à des charges extrêmes ou de pistons en plastique léger de nouvelle génération dotés d’un revêtement anticorrosion avancé.La nouvelle gamme Monroe Magnum comprend des ressorts pneumatiques convolutés, idéaux pour le levage d’essieux sur véhicules multi-essieux, ainsi que pour le levage pneumatique et l’isolation des vibrations en milieu industriel ; des ressorts pneumatiques anti-retournement, offrant une meilleure stabilité latérale afin de maintenir le contrôle du véhicule dans les virages et lors de charges déséquilibrées ; et des ressorts pneumatiques complets disponibles en conception légère et durable (pistons en plastique) ou en conception ultra-résistante (pistons en acier). Chaque ressort pneumatique est conçu pour maintenir la hauteur de caisse et le centre de gravité corrects du véhicule, afin d’assurer la stabilité des charges et la sécurité des conducteurs sur des parcours exigeants.Les ressorts pneumatiques jouent un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la sécurité et de la productivité des véhicules, ainsi que dans la réduction des coûts globaux d’entretien des véhicules. En absorbant efficacement les chocs de la route et les vibrations intenses, ils protègent les autres composants de la suspension contre l’usure prématurée et les défaillances.« La défaillance des ressorts pneumatiques est l’une des principales causes d’immobilisation des véhicules pour les flottes et autres exploitants de véhicules commerciaux », a expliqué M.

        "text": "Wolfspeed (WOLF) stock has seen some major changes in the last couple of days. Some investors were jumping for joy when they saw reports that the stock had jumped more than 1,600% yesterday, only to find that when they checked their portfolios, they were down -- a lot. So what's going on?Shareholder dilutionThe struggling chipmakerfiled forChapter 11 bankruptcy protectionon June 30 this year after its debt grew unmanageable. The company successfully negotiated a massive reduction of its debt -- about 70%. With its creditors satisfied, on Monday, Wolfspeed announced its \"emergence from Chapter 11 protection.\"But as you might expect, reducing your debt by that much comes with some pretty hefty strings attached. A key step, which it executed yesterday, was to replace its existing stock with shares of a \"new\" stock. This new stock would be distributed to both its creditors and its common shareholders, but not evenly.That's why, despite the massive jump in the stock price yesterday, the value of shareholders' portfolios plummeted. They received roughly one share for every 120 they owned, while its creditors received the lion's share of Wolfspeed's new shares.Image source: Getty Images.The situation highlights how critical it is for investors to truly understand what they are investing in. Bankruptcy is complicated, and these sorts of \"details\" can get lost in the shuffle but radically change the value of an investment.Should you buy Wolfspeed stock now?I wouldn't. Wolfspeed still has its work cut out for it. The company's key customer base is the electric vehicle (EV) market, and EVs have their own issues these days. Its debt is reduced, but not eliminated, and the company still needs to correct the operational and strategic issues that got it in trouble to begin with.On top of that, its new stock could still face further dilution.",

        "lead": "Target's stock has fallen 40% over the past year, but the company is positioning for a potential turnaround with a new CEO and showing signs of improvement in customer traffic.",
        "text": "Target (TGT-0.54%) is one of the largest retailers in the United States. It is also a Dividend King, with over five decades of annual dividend increases behind it. And the business is struggling today, which has resulted in a material decline in the stock price. But it's a no-brainer buy for investors that like turnaround stories even as the broader stock market sits near all-time highs. Here's why.Target is not hitting on all cylindersIn the second quarter of 2025, Target's sales fell 0.9%, withsame-store salesoff by 1.9%. Those are not good numbers, given that the business basically shrunk in the quarter. No wonder investors are so negative on the stock, having pushed the shares down around 40% over the past year even as the S&P 500 index (^GSPC0.01%) has risen to record highs, up roughly 15%, over the same span.The board of directorsisn't sitting around hoping for the best. It has brought in a new CEO to shake things up. The revamp will likely take some time, but given the company's status asa Dividend King, it seems likely that it will eventually succeed. After all, you don't create a dividend record like that without working through some rough patches.What you are really buying here isa turnaround story. And that story will play out regardless of what happens with the S&P 500 index. That is the reason to think that Target is a no-brainer buy, assuming you like turnaround stocks. On the turnaround front it is worth noting that the second-quarter results were an improvement over the first quarter's results, with a notable increase in customer traffic. The worst could, in fact, already be over.",

        "lead": "Realty Income, a large REIT with over 15,600 properties, offers a stable 5.4% monthly dividend yield with a consistent history of dividend growth, making it an attractive passive income investment option.",
        "text": "Earning passive income can be a life-changing endeavor. The more passive income you can make, the less time you'll need to spend working in the future. Collecting passive income can also help with easing financial stresses, since you'll know you still have some income coming in if you ever lose your job.If you want to start earning steadypassive incomethis October, buying shares of Realty Income (O0.56%) is an ideal starting point. The real estate investment trust (REIT) provides a high-yieldingmonthly dividend, which it has consistently increased for decades. Realty Income's proven record of dividend growth provides confidence, making it an ideal dividend stock to consider buying this month to generate recurring passive income in the years to come.A dependable dividend stockRealty Income is one of the largest REITs in the world. It owns over 15,600 properties across the U.S. and Europe. Its portfolio spans retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties that are secured by long-termnet leaseswith many of the world's leading companies. That combination of diversification and lease structure -- tenants cover all property operating costs -- enables Realty Income to collect very stable rental income.The company's high-quality real estate portfolio provides a very strong foundation for its monthly dividend, which currently yields 5.4%. Realty Income pays out roughly 75% of its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) in dividends. FFO is a metric REITs use to approximate their available free cash flow for dividend payments. That conservativedividend payout ratioprovides Realty Income with a significant cushion to weather any future financial crisis, while allowing it to retain a substantial amount of cash flow each year to invest in additional income-producing properties (over $760 million expected in 2025).Realty Income also has one of the 10 best balance sheets in the REIT sector. That enables it to access low-cost funding to support its continued growth.The REIT's combination of stable income and conservative financial profile has enabled it to pay a very dependable dividend over the decades. Realty Income has paid 663 consecutive monthly dividends throughout its history. It has raised its payment 132 times since its public market listing in 1994, including the past 112 quarters in a row. The landlord has grown its dividend at a 4.2% compound annual rate over its more than three decades as a public company. That has made it one of the most reliable dividend growers in the industry.Image source: Getty Images.Plenty of room to continue growingRealty Income currently owns about $61 billion of real estate in nine countries, making it the sixth-largest REIT. That's a small fraction of the estimated $14 trillion opportunity it sees ahead to invest in global net-lease properties.The opportunity is so vast that Realty Income can be highly selective, only moving forward with the best new investment opportunities. For example, Realty Income sourced $43 billion of potential deals in the second quarter. However, it only closed $1.2 billion of transactions, or 2.7% of its sourced volume, as it stayed very disciplined.Realty Income's increasingly diversified platform enables it to cast a wide net and find the best investment opportunities. The company has steadily added new investment verticals over the years, expanding its total addressable market opportunity. It has recently started investing in U.S. gaming properties (a $400 million investment opportunity) and U.S.data centers(a $500 million market opportunity). Realty Income has also expanded into additional European markets and launched a credit investment platform to enhance its long-term growth potential.The company has the financial capacity to invest billions of dollars each year ($5 billion investment volume expected in 2025). These new property investments will steadily increase Realty Income's FFO per share, which should enable it to continue raising its dividend payments.A foundational income stockRealty Income is an ideal stock to buy and hold for passive income. With its dividend currently yielding around 5.4%, every $1,000 invested in the REIT can generate about $54 of annual passive income, which should steadily rise as the landlord increases its dividend. The prospect of collecting a steadily rising payout is why you can buy Realty Income this month and never look back.",

        "text": "There is a surprising amount of debate over the difference betweenvalue stocksandgrowth stocks. Typically, growth stocks are defined as companies with high growth rates that are priced at high valuation multiples. Value stocks, on the other hand, typically have lower growth rates and trade at more modest valuation multiples.But as Warren Buffett has often said, price is what you pay, value is what you get. By this definition, a value stock is simply one that you can buy for less than it's really worth. And right now, there's one investment you can make that could come to look like a bargain in 2026.Tesla shows how this stock could win 2026For its long-term holders, Tesla has been one of the greatest investments of all time. Since 2010, its shares have risen in value by more than 34,000%. There were many factors behind the company's rise, but perhaps the most pivotal catalyst has been the company's ability to ship affordable electric vehicles to markets around the world.Roughly 70% of car buyers in the U.S. say they are looking to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle. Looking abroad, getting penetration in many emerging markets requires automakers to offer low-cost options. Tesla's dominance in the electric vehicle (EV) space today largely has to do with its ability to meet the needs of buyers who don't have $100,000 or more to spend.In 2017, Tesla launched its first EV to be priced under $50,000: the Model 3. This achievement was nearly 15 years in the making, requiring billions of dollars of investment. Three years later, it debuted another affordable vehicle: the Model Y. Today, more than 90% of the company's vehicle sales stem from these two models.Importantly, the sales ramp-up was fairly slow. Tesla sold fewer than 2,000 Model 3s in 2017. But that figure grew to 300,000 by 2019. Tesla's Model Y proved even more popular, and total sales of these two models reached 1.2 million in 2022. For comparison, the Model X and Model S -- Tesla's luxury models -- sold only 66,000 combined units in 2022.Right now, anotherEV companyis about to follow in Tesla's footsteps by launching its own affordable models, and there's reason to believe its sales ramp-up could be even steeper. Yet its shares trade at a relatively low valuation compared to its peers and growth potential.Rivian is racing to become the next TeslaWhen Rivian (RIVN0.85%) went public in 2021, it was undoubtedly a growth stock. That year, the company'smarket caphit $150 billion, with shares trading at huge multiples of its trailing sales. Today, its market cap is below $20 billion, and its price-to-sales ratio sits well below competitors like Lucid Group and Tesla.What happened? Several factors contributed to Rivian's decline. New regulatory headwinds against electric vehicles and the government's decision to end federal subsidies on purchases have put pressure on many EV makers and their stock prices. Meanwhile, a lack of new model introductions has slowed Rivian's growth trajectory. By far the biggest factor, however, was simply that the market previously overvalued the company. But after a steep decline, it looks like Rivian's valuation has slid too far, giving value investors a tempting buying opportunity.Over the last year and a half, Rivian's revenues have essentially held steady. But in 2026, management expects to begin production of three new affordable models: the R2, R3, and R3X. All three are SUVs -- the most popular, fastest-growing category of vehicle. EV sales in general have also exploded since the introductions of the Model Y and Model 3, giving Rivian a much more mature environment to operate in.With all that in mind, Rivian's sales launch could outpace Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y launch. That could be a critical catalyst, considering these launches were partially what made Tesla into the $1.4 trillion behemoth it is today. With a market cap of just $18 billion, Rivian's valuation simply doesn't account for how much growth these new models could provide it with in 2026 and beyond.",

        "title": "Shopify and Etsy Just Got a Surprising Boost From ChatGPT",
        "lead": "OpenAI launched Instant Checkout, a new feature allowing ChatGPT users to purchase products directly from Etsy and soon Shopify, potentially bringing millions of new buyers to these platforms.",
        "text": "Handcrafted marketplace Etsy (ETSY-0.22%) reported a nearly 5% drop in gross sales on its platform when it released financial results for the second quarter of 2025. ButOpenAI-- the world's most recognizableartificial intelligence(AI) start-up -- could finally give the flailing marketplace the boost that it needs.On Sept. 29, Etsy stock soared 16% after OpenAI announced that it was partnering with the e-commerce platform for a brand new AI product. It's called Instant Checkout. And it will allow users of OpenAI'sChatGPTto order Etsy products directly in the chat.Etsy won't be ChatGPT's only partner. OpenAI also announced that Shopify (SHOP6.52%) integration is coming soon. Shopify is an e-commerce software company used by millions of online stores. And OpenAI says that around 1 million of them will be using Instant Checkout.What's happening at OpenAI could represent the practical application of a long-awaited trend in AI: agentic AI. And I believe it could be a material development for Etsy.Why this could be big for EtsyPersonal computing pioneer Bill Gates has been talking about this subject for 30 years. He was famously instrumental in making software more accessible for the general public. But he's long believed that agents would be a big computing wave once they were good enough. And it seems that with AI, their time has finally come.There are some who envision a future where AI agents can interact with multiple products and platforms, do a range of tasks on your behalf, and become personalized over time as they learn your behavior. And that's the idea here with ChatGPT's Instant Checkout. Users can simply describe what they're looking for as well as provide a price point and the AI agent can find and buy the item for you.ChatGPT developed this new feature in partnership with privately held fintech companyStripe. To me, the key quote from the press release was, \"For sellers, it's a new way to reach hundreds of millions of people.\" This must be music to Etsy's ears.According to OpenAI, around 700 million people use ChatGPT every week. For comparison, Etsy only had 93 million active buyers as of Q2, which was a drop. Let's imagine that just 1% of ChatGPT users take advantage of Instant Checkout in the next year and buy something from Etsy. That would represent 7 million buyers, which is nearly 8% of Etsy's current user base.Etsy's revenue is at an all-time high and it still has great profit margins. ButEtsy stockhas dropped more than 70% from its all-time high because revenue growth has slowed dramatically and user growth has completely stalled. An integration with one of the hottest companies on the planet could be just the spark that Etsy needs.I believe that this development might be less impactful forShopify stock. The company believes the best way to grow its business is to provide its customers with as many software options as possible. So integrating with OpenAI's ChatGPT is a good strategic move for this reason. But it would probably be more impactful for Shopify's customers rather than for Shopify itself.What about OpenAI?OpenAI will reportedly generate around $13 billion in 2025 revenue. But according to some counts, the company has plans to spend $850 billion in coming years -- it's clearlyplanning to spend way beyond its capabilities, which calls its plans into question for some.Regardless, OpenAI will need to exponentially grow its revenue to justify this level of spending and the level of investment it's looking to attract. There are limits to how big its revenue base can grow with current products, making the launch of new products crucial.OpenAI will generate revenue from Instant Checkout by taking a small cut of each transaction -- a take rate. I don't know how meaningful this revenue stream will be for OpenAI. But I do know that it needs something so any movement in this direction is helpful.For Etsy shareholders, I wouldn't be worried about OpenAI's cut of the transaction. If AI agents can bring incremental business to Etsy's platform through ChatGPT's Instant Checkout, I believe it's a net positive.As a shareholder myself, I'll be looking for signs of life in Etsy's business fairly soon as a result of this news from OpenAI. In the early days of a new AI product launch, there's a novelty factor that can quickly drive activity. So if there's anything promising here I would expect to find signs of its promise early on.",

        "lead": "Despite a $1.6 billion write-down in Q2, Lockheed Martin remains a strong defense contractor with significant government contracts, consistent dividend growth, and potential for future expansion.",
        "text": "I can't resist a Rocky movie -- whether our hero is battling Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, or Victor Drago, there's nothing like cheering Rocky as he gets off the mat, steps forward, and wins it for Adrian or Mick.Right now, I feel like Lockheed Martin (LMT1.05%) is thedefense stockequivalent of The Italian Stallion. Lockheed had a rough second quarter, taking $1.6 billion in charges that pushed earnings way down. The stock is essentially flat so far this year and is down 15% from a year ago.But to put it in Rocky film parlance, this fight's not over.Lockheed Martin stockhas a lot left in the tank and gives me the \"Yo, I didn't hear no bell\" swagger.In short, an investment of $5,000 into LMT stock could provide an excellent return in the next few years.About Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, operating space, intelligence, defense, and security solutions to the U.S. government. The company is best known for its military aircraft, including the F-35 Lightning fighter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, and MH-60 helicopters.The company has four units: Aeronautics for tactical aircraft and related equipment, Missiles and Fire Control for weapon systems, Rotary and Mission Systems for helicopters and maritime systems, and Space for civil, commercial, and weather spacecraft and missile defense systems.The company reported $18.2 billion inrevenuein the second quarter, up from $18.1 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $342 million and $1.46 per share, which was a sharp drop from a year ago when it reported $1.6 billion in net earnings and $6.85 per share.Management said the difference was on account of $1.6 billion in recorded program losses in the Aeronautics Classified Program and two international programs with the Sikorsky business unit. The Aeronautics program has been plagued with design and test challenges, management said, resulting in changes to the program's processes and testing approach and a writedown of $950 million. Sikorsky helicopter programs for Canada and Turkey also saw additional losses totaling $665 million as the scopes of those programs changed.CFO Evan Scott said:We have a focused team engaged with these programs on a daily basis. Actively implementing our adjusted approach and working to prevent charges like this going forward. We continue to learn, and the fact is these are important, although challenging programs, and Lockheed Martin has a long legacy of innovation and navigating complex issues. We're confident over the long term that we'll be able to manage these issues and continue extending our track record of delivering for the customer, and our shareholders.It's time for the training montageIf we're keeping with the Rocky analogy, this would be the montage part of the movie where our hero starts training and scaling those museum stairs. Because you know Lockheed Martin will come out fighting from this misstep.First, it's still stacking up wins. It just got a $10.8 billion contract to build up to 99 helicopters for the Marines, scored a $9.8 billion contract from the Army for nearly 2,000 Patriot defense missiles, and was awarded a prototype agreement to partner with the Army in creating a next-generation command prototype that will help commanders make faster decisions.The company also ended the second quarter with a backlog of $166.5 billion in projects, having delivered 50 F-35s and 24 government helicopters during the quarter.Winning the fightThat nasty $1.6 billion write-down makes Lockheed Martin stock look like a risk. But it's really not. Currently theprice-to-earnings ratiois 27.6, which is much higher than the 10-year mean of 20. But the current ratio is higher only because the write-off knocked earnings way down. If you look at the forward P/E ratio of 22.4, that's much closer to Lockheed's historical prices.Then consider Lockheed Martin's generousdividend. Currently the company's paying $13.20 in dividends per year, with a yield of 2.7%. And the dividend is growing consistently, having risen 100% in the last 10 years. That's also very appealing when you consider the stock's 144% growth over the same decade.LMT Dividenddata byYChartsLockheed Martin is expected to see 5% growth this year and 4% growth in 2026. Assuming conservatively that it keeps at 4% growth with a 2.7% dividend yield, then investors would be looking at 6.7% growth each year. And that is achievable, considering that Lockheed Martin increased net income by 70% in the last decade.Thus, your $5,000 investment in Lockheed Martin would come close to doubling in just a decade.So in the end, Lockheed Martin's taking some punches right now. But like Rocky, it's built to go the distance.",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos acknowledged that artificial intelligence is in \"a kind of industrial bubble\" but stressed that the technology is real and will deliver \"gigantic\" benefits to society.Bezos Calls AI Bubble ConstructiveAt Italian Tech Week in Turin on Friday, Bezos described the current surge in AI investment as fitting the definition of a bubble, noting that valuations are frequently detached from the underlying business fundamentals.He explained that during bubbles, every experiment gets funded — the good ideas and the bad ideas, adding that it becomes difficult for investors to separate winners from losers.\"That's also probably happening today,\" he noted.However, the Amazon founder said that this does not diminish AI's transformative potential. \"AI is real and it is going to change every industry,\" he stated, calling the hype cycle a natural stage of innovation.Lessons From Past Industrial BubblesBezos compared the present AI boom to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, when many startups collapsed but breakthroughs in medicine and drug development ultimately benefited society.\"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, societies benefits from those inventions,\" he said.Zuckerberg And Altman Raise Bubble ConcernsBezos's remarks echo concerns from other tech leaders, including Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, both of whom have admitted the industryshows bubble-like traits.Zuckerberg warned earlier this month that today's AI spending frenzy could mirror the dot-com boom-and-bust cycle, but suggested that AI development might avoid a collapse if both model capabilities and demand continue to grow annually.Investors Weigh In On AI FrenzyWall Street remains divided. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Friday cautioned that market enthusiasm could lead to a \"reset\" in valuations,reportedCNBC.Earlier this month, investment firm GQG Partners compared the AI boom to the 1999 dot-com crash,citing inflated fundamentals.By contrast, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives dismissed collapse fears, calling AI the \"fourth industrial revolution\" and predicting theindustry is still in the \"second inning.\"Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings rank Amazon's growth in the 92nd percentile,underscoring its strong performance relative to top AI peerslike META.Read Next:Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by BenzingaImage via ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

        "text": "SAN DIEGO, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLPannounces that the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit seeks to represent purchasers or acquirers of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) securities between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Captioned Hindlemann v. Molina Healthcare, Inc., No. 25-cv-09461 (C.D. Cal.), the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit charges Molina Healthcare and certain of Molina Healthcare’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-molina-healthcare-inc-class-action-lawsuit-moh.htmlYou can also contact attorneysJ.C. SanchezorJennifer N. Caringalof Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail atinfo@rgrdlaw.com.CASE ALLEGATIONS: Molina Healthcare provides managed healthcare services to low-income families and individuals under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces.The Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose: (i) material, adverse facts concerning Molina Healthcare’s “medical cost trend assumptions”; (ii) that Molina Healthcare was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend”; (iii) that Molina Healthcare’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services”; and (iv) as a result, Molina Healthcare’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut.The Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 7, 2025, Molina Healthcare revealed second quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of approximately $5.50 per share, which was “below its prior expectations” due to “medical cost pressures in all three lines of business.” Molina Healthcare also disclosed that it “expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year,” cut guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share 10.2% at the midpoint, and that it was experiencing a “short-term earnings pressure” from a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend which has recently accelerated,” the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of Molina Healthcare stock fell, according to the complaint.Then, the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit alleges that on July 23, 2025 Molina Healthcare reported its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 and further cut its full-year 2025 earnings guidance. In doing so, Molina Healthcare revealed that “GAAP net income was $4.75 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2025, a decrease of 8% year over year” and it “now expects its full year 2025 adjusted earnings to be no less than $19.00 per diluted share,” the Molina Healthcare class action alleges. Molina Healthcare allegedly attributed its results and full year outlook to a “challenging medical cost trend environment,” including “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services.” On this news, the price of Molina Healthcare stock fell nearly 17%, according to the complaint.THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Molina Healthcare securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Molina Healthcare class action lawsuit.ABOUT ROBBINS GELLER: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP is one of the world’s leading law firms representing investors in securities fraud and shareholder litigation.

Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to the results of Altimmune’s IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In truth, Altimmune failed to meet an important statistical significance marker relating to the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint. Altimmune had consistently touted its inflated expectations for positive topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial, while concealing higher responses in the placebo group, which they knew or should have known would negatively impact the topline results. Altimmune’s IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial results fell short of reality, as shown by Altimmune’s topline data, which show that the statistical significance was not achieved for the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Altimmune class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=22535or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or emailcase@rosenlegal.comfor more information.No Class Has Been Certified.

        "title": "Why I'm Reconsidering Starbucks' Role in My Portfolio -- Is There a Better Investment for Income and Growth?",
        "lead": "An investor is evaluating Starbucks stock performance, considering potential replacements like Academy Sports and Arcos Dorados due to underwhelming growth, while still maintaining hope for potential recovery under new leadership.",
        "text": "In June 2020, I happily invested in one of my favorite consumer brands: Coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX-0.36%). But after it's underperformed the returns from the S&P 500 by a wide margin over these five years, it's high time I reconsidered its role in my portfolio.I believed thatStarbucks stockwould provide my portfolio with a blend of growth and income. For growth, I was quite optimistic that the company's business in China would quickly rebound from the pandemic and unlock much higher earnings. That hasn't happened. With it now looking for strategic options for its China business, it's time for me to wave the white flag here.Regarding income, Starbucks didn't disappoint. It's increased its dividend payment every year that I've held it, and is currently on a 14-year streak of doing that. And as of this writing,the dividend yieldis approaching 3%, which is close to the highest it's ever been.Therefore, I can't really complain when it comes to dividend income from Starbucks stock. But growth has been lacking. Going back to just before the pandemic started, Starbucks has averaged a single-digitcompound annual growth rate(CAGR) for revenue. This often isn't good enough to propel market-beating stock performance. So the question is: Can I find a comparable dividend-paying stock that offers better growth? Indeed, there are some options.1. Academy Sports & OutdoorsWith only 300 locations, sporting goods retailer Academy Sports (ASO1.66%) is easy to overlook. But if management has its way, the company could put up better top-line growth than Starbucks from here.Perhaps the biggest way that Academy Sports is driving revenue growth is by opening new stores. This year, it hopes to open up to 25 locations. It had already opened eight of these by the end of the second quarter of 2025. Past guidance suggests that the company intends to open around 150 additional locations by the end of 2028.These new store openings could allow Academy Sports to deliver a double-digit growth rate in coming years. Management is also known for methodically returning cash to shareholders. Itbuys back stock, and its quarterly dividend has grown at a nice pace in recent years.ASO Shares Outstandingdata byYCharts.With a dividend yield of only 1%, Academy Sports won't necessarily attract income investors today. But those with a long-term view hope to ride the company's growth plans to much higher earnings in time, which could result in much better dividend income down the road.2. Arcos DoradosRestaurant chain Arcos Dorados (ARCO-0.30%) owns the rights to the McDonald's brand in 21 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, allowing it to own and operate franchised locations and sub-franchise to other operators. With over 2,400 locations, it's the largest independent McDonald's franchisee.Differences in currency exchange rates are masking double-digit revenue growth for Arcos Dorados. For the second quarter of 2025, the company reported just 3% year-over-year growth. But adjusting for currency fluctuations, it grew by 15%. This includes bothsame-store salesgrowth and the contribution of new restaurant locations.With a 3.5% dividend yield, Arcos Dorados stock is more attractive than Starbucks stock as an income investment. The company alsopays outjust a small portion of its earnings as a dividend, leaving plenty of room for future growth.About one-third of Arcos Dorados' locations are sub-franchised. And like McDonald's itself, Arcos Dorados generates some revenue from its franchisees via rental income -- it owns the land and buildings at nearly 500 locations. This real estate layer to the business can make it a stronger investment compared to other restaurant companies.3. Stick with Starbucks?Over my investing career, I've learned to onlysell a stockafter taking plenty of time to think it over. So while I'm thinking about selling Starbucks stock and buying a replacement that's growing faster and still offers income, it's not a done deal. In fact, I see some reason to continue holding Starbucks stock.It's been just over one year since Starbucks hired new CEO Brian Niccol, and he's still trying to reinvigorate the brand. That starts with bringing back the more inviting coffeehouse atmosphere. The company just announced that it will close hundreds of locations that don't fit its vision.Niccol's plan comes with an expensive price tag of around $1 billion. But investors' expectations are now low, and Starbucks can start bouncing back as difficult decisions pay off.For now, I believe the downside risk for Starbucks stock is low because it's still a top consumer brand and Niccol has a good reputation as an operator. Academy Sports and Arcos Dorados are on my radar as potentially filling the role in my portfolio currently filled by Starbucks. But I see no reason to rush this decision today, so I'll keep holding Starbucks stock for now.",

        "text": "Los Angeles, CA, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barkly, a women-founded pet tech and safety brand, today announced the launch of its premium retractable dog leash engineered to help women feel safer and more confident while walking their dogs. Designed by co-founders Dr. Holly Jordan, DVM, and Drew Evenson, Barkly combines sleek, ergonomic craftsmanship with built-in personal safety features, including a 130-decibel alarm and flashing strobe light for visibility and deterrence.The idea for Barkly was born from a familiar feeling many women know too well: the unease of walking alone after dark or in quiet areas. Dr. Jordan, a practicing veterinarian, and Evenson, an experienced entrepreneur, recognized a gap in the market for a product that could offer both pet tech and personal safety without sacrificing design.“We wanted to create something beautiful and functional that lets women enjoy everyday walks without fear,” said co-founder Drew Evenson. “Barkly is more than a leash — it’s peace of mind.”Since its soft launch just weeks ago, Barkly has seen strong early traction. The brand grew an email community of over 1,600 dog owners before launch and has already sold its first production run through Amazon and Shopify. Barkly’s story has resonated widely online, with pet parents sharing their excitement about a leash that not only keeps them and their dogs safe but also helps them feel more secure. The company is currently in conversations with major retailers and pet industry partners to expand its reach.Barkly’s founders say the goal is bigger than just a single product. “This is about designing with empathy,” said co-founder Dr. Holly Jordan. “We’re starting with a smarter, safer leash, but our vision is to build an entire ecosystem of pet products that put the owner’s safety and confidence first.”With growing demand from pet owners seeking safety, tech and style in one, Barkly is poised to redefine the category of dog accessories — moving beyond function to create products that empower and protect.About BarklyBarkly is a women-founded pet tech and safety brand focused on empowering dog owners — especially women — to feel secure and confident on every walk. Founded by veterinarian Dr. Holly Jordan and entrepreneur Drew Evenson, Barkly merges thoughtful design with safety-first innovation.

This milestone empowers enterprises to modernize data systems, embed GenAI into operations, and achieve faster, measurable outcomes across industries while lowering costs and cycle times.Photo Courtesy of MactoresBELLEVUE, Wash., Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mactores Cognition Inc., a leading business consulting and data analytics firm, today announced it has signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and achieved the AWS Generative AI Competency.

        "lead": "The article compares Amazon and Alphabet as leading tech companies with strong AI potential, analyzing their market positions, growth prospects, and investment attractiveness in the evolving technology landscape.",
        "text": "Given how much impact the tech sector has on the U.S. and global economies these days -- a trend that might become even more prominent in the years and decades ahead -- it's important that investors allocate some portion of their portfolios to these kinds of businesses. This smart strategy can certainly help to boost portfolio returns over the long haul.Amazon (AMZN-1.34%) and Alphabet (GOOG-0.04%) (GOOGL-0.16%) are two great options to consider. They each possess very favorable traits that make them worthy investment candidates. But which of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks is the best one to buy right now?Amazon's sprawling empireWhat makes Amazon unique is that it has its hands in multiple tech-driven markets. For instance, the company is the undisputed leader in online shopping. As the economy expands, spending activity increases, and more transactions shift away from brick-and-mortar retailers, Amazon will keep gaining.The business is involved in a more exciting area, withAmazon Web Services(AWS) being the leading cloud computing platform in the world. AWS has become an essential partner for its customers, as they move their IT workloads off-premises and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools more. It's contributing more to the overall company's finances, with annualized revenue of $124 billion in the second quarter (ended June 30) and a stellar operating margin of 32.9%. Investors might be interested in owning this stock simply to have exposure to AWS.Digital advertising is another high-potential area that Amazon has a strong position in. It helped produce almost $16 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, which represented a 22% year-over-year increase. Just in the U.S., Amazon's ad services can reach an audience of more than 300 million people.It's already a colossal organization. And Amazon is in a good position to keep growing at healthy clip for a long time.Alphabet leads the AI raceAlphabet is a top choice for investors who want greater exposure to the AI boom. Given the huge capital investments taking place, as well as the general bullishness surrounding this trend, betting on AI seems like a smart move.Alphabet is involved in many parts of this powerful secular trend. It works on AI research at DeepMind. It develops its own chips, having a presence in infrastructure hardware.With Google Cloud, which is a direct competitor to AWS, Alphabet has a key platform that serves AI needs of its customers. The company'sGemini large language modelsare embedded into its user-facing apps. And Alphabet is leveraging AI to improve capabilities for its advertising customers.While the market seemed to be worried at first that AI was going to dismantle Alphabet, the business is performing well. Revenue and operating income both increased by 14% during the second quarter. Google Search, the company's bread and butter, saw sales rise 12%. Management points to strong adoption of the product's AI Mode feature.The business is in an enviable position. It possesses many durablecompetitive advantages, like network effects and its unrivaled ability to collect and leverage data. Plus, it has a fortress balance sheet that minimizes financial risk.Think about upsideAmazon and Alphabet are two of the best businesses in the world. They dominate the markets that they operate in, and that isn't going to change anytime soon.Investors should consider the potential upside over the next five years and beyond. Profit growth is one important area to look at. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Amazon'searnings per shareare projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 18.6% between 2024 and 2027, higher than Alphabet's expected 14.6% yearly pace.Valuation is also another critical component. Amazon shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2. Alphabet's trade at a cheaper multiple of 23.4.I don't see why investors can't own both of these wonderful companies.",

        "lead": "Kirby McInerney LLP is investigating a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Nutex Health Inc. involving allegations of fraudulent billing practices and financial reporting issues, which caused significant stock price declines in July and August 2025.",
        "text": "NEW YORK, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you have suffered a loss on your Nutex Health Inc. (“Nutex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NUTX) investment, contact Thomas W. Elrod of Kirby McInerney LLP by email atinvestigations@kmllp.com, or fill out the contact form below to discuss your rights or interests in the securities fraud class action lawsuit at no cost.Investors have until October 21, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint them as lead plaintiff.[CONTACT THE FIRM IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS]What Happened?On July 22, 2025, Blue Orca Capital released a report alleging, among other things, that Nutex’s third-party dispute resolution vendor, HaloMD, achieved lucrative results for healthcare billing clients like Nutex by engaging in a coordinated fraudulent scheme to steal millions of dollars from insurance companies. The report was supported by recent lawsuits filed by three major insurance companies against HaloMD. On this news, the price of Nutex shares declined by $11.18 per share, or approximately 10.05%, from $111.19 per share on July 21, 2025 to close at $100.01 on July 22, 2025.Then, on August 14, 2025, Nutex announced that it would delay filing its quarterly report with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the period ending June 30, 2025, citing “non-cash accounting adjustments related to the treatment of stock-based compensation obligations for certain under-construction and ramping hospitals.” The price of Nutex shares declined by $18.22 per share, or approximately 16.39%, to close at $92.91 per share on August 15, 2025.What Is The Lawsuit About?The lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased securities during the period of August 8, 2024 through August 14, 2025, inclusive (“the Class Period”). The lawsuit alleges that Nutex made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) HaloMD was achieving lucrative arbitration results for Nutex by engaging in a coordinated scheme to defraud insurance companies; (ii) as a result, revenues attributable to the Company's engagement with HaloMD in the IDR process were unsustainable; (iii) in addition, the Company overstated the extent to which it had remediated, and/or its ability to remediate, the material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting; (iv) as a result, the Company was unable to effectively account for the treatment of certain of its stock based compensation obligations; (v) as a result, Nutex improperly calculated these stock based compensation obligations as equity rather than liabilities; (vi) the foregoing increased the risk that the Company would be unable to timely file certain financial reports with the SEC; and (vii) accordingly, Nutex's business and/or financial prospects were overstated.[CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION]Kirby McInerney LLPis a New York-based plaintiffs’ law firm concentrating in securities, antitrust, whistleblower, and consumer litigation.

(NASDAQ: LFMD) between May 7, 2025 and August 5, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important October 27, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased LifeMD securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the LifeMD class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43404or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or emailcase@rosenlegal.comfor information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 27, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants materially overstated LifeMD’s competitive position; (2) defendants were reckless in raising LifeMD’s 2025 guidance, considering that they had not properly accounted for rising customer acquisition costs in LifeMD’s RexMD segment, as well as for customer acquisition costs related to the sale of drugs designed to treat obesity, including Wegovy and Zepbound; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about LifeMD’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the LifeMD class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43404or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or emailcase@rosenlegal.comfor information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

At the start of the week, a new all-time high for Robinhood meant the company’s shares had breached $140. But the gains have kept rolling in. Robinhood’s stock is now closing in on $150 with more than an hour left before the closing bell on Friday.The company, which trades under theHOODticker on the Nasdaq, has gained 21.69% in the past five days and nearly 47% in the past month.The latest news from CEO Vlad Tenev is that Strategy preferred stock offerings, like Stretch (STRC) and Strike (STRK), are now available on its platform.“We've heard from many Strategy investors that this was an important factor before moving their accounts to Robinhood, and we're excited to unlock this for them,” Tenev saidon X.Meanwhile, Strategy had its own bullish news this week, but hasn’t gotten anywhere near its all-time high of $473.83.

Right now crypto assets can be traded all the time. And there are plenty of crypto derivatives exchanges—Deribit being the largest—that offer the same always-on hours.But CME said clients have said they want around-the-clock risk management on a regulated venue.CME said it’s officially planning to make the move—but it all depends on regulatory review. There’s already been signs that regulators are on board with allowing certain assets to be tradeable all the time.In fact, theSEC and CFTCsaid as much a month ago—but that was about making securities tradeable all the time.In the 154 years since continuous trading debuted on Wall Street, such markets have always followed a strict schedule, which since 1985 has kept markets open only during certain business hours on weekdays.Other KeysIn a Galaxy not far away…Samsung isintegrating Coinbaseaccess within its wallet app for U.S. users, which means crypto holdings could now be used through Samsung Wallet and Samsung Pay.

        "title": "Here's Why Whirlpool Shares Slumped in September",
        "lead": "Whirlpool experienced a 15.6% stock decline in September due to housing market weakness, high interest rates, and intense competition from Asian manufacturers. Despite current challenges, the company is well-positioned to benefit from tariff policies and potential market improvements.",
        "text": "Whirlpool (WHR0.63%) shares declined by 15.6% in September, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. The decline comes down to a combination of investors \"selling on the news\" of a rate cut and a relatively disappointing bond market reaction to the Federal Reserve rate cut in mid-September. Still, there's a bull case to be made for buying the stock in a dip. Here's the lowdown.Whirlpool's difficult 2025Two big external events are impacting Whirlpool this year. The first is the impact of interest rates on the housing market, specifically on home sales volumes. Homeowners typically undertake discretionary spending on major domestic appliances as they prepare their homes for sale or move into a recently purchased home.As such, when mortgage rates rise and put pressure on home sales (see the chart below), Whirlpool's higher-margin discretionary sales will be weakened. Indeed, management noted in its second-quarter earnings presentation that U.S. demand for appliances from discretionary purchases contributed 30% of the total demand from 2015 to 2020. Still, that figure had dropped to just 20% by 2025.30 Year Mortgage Ratedata byYCharts.Foreign competition and tariffsThe second event is the behavior of Asian competitors in response to the threat oftariffsearlier in the year and then after the tariffs on Asian countries were imposed, which were subsequently paused until Aug. 1. In both cases, Whirlpool's Asian competitors responded by preloading the market ahead of the full impact of tariffs.Throw in the ongoing weakness in thehousingmarket, and there's a perfect recipe for an intensely competitive pricing and promotional environment. That's precisely what happened to Whirlpool this year, and it's unlikely to ease until Asian competitors sell down the inventory they've loaded into the market -- something that would occur much more quickly in a lower interest rate environment.Image source: Getty Images.What happened in SeptemberWhile it's impossible to know precisely why investors behave the way they do, my best guess would be that investors bought the stock on the rumor of a rate cut and then sold it on the news of it.In addition, the reality is that market rates and mortgage rates are largely unchanged from their levels when the Federal Reserve cut its rate in mid-September.30 Year Mortgage Ratedata byYCharts.What's next for WhirlpoolThere won't be a quick fix to Whirlpool's pressures, and it's unlikely that all of its recent competitive underperformance is due to external factors. That said, the company now generates 62% of its sales from major domestic appliances in North America, and 80% of what it sells in the U.S. is made in the US.In other words, it's well positioned to benefit from the Trump administration's tariff regime, and if it can navigate a difficult period, next year could be a significantly better environment for the company.",

So it wasn't surprising that the coin's rise over the past few days was giving a lift to the company's equity too. As of late-session trading on Friday, Hut 8's share price was up by almost 18%, according to data compiled byS&P Global Market Intelligence.What's good for the goose...When the market is bullish forBitcoin, it usually gets positive about the prospects for miners too. The cryptocurrency is obviously being considered something of a safe haven during the federal government shutdown; along with other tailwinds it has sent the coin's value up by almost 13% since last Friday afternoon.Image source: Getty Images.Toward the end of the week, there was another factor driving the stock prices of miners north. This was Canaan's announcement Thursday that it had received an order forover 50,000of its crypto mining rigs from a customer it did not identify.This is the largest order in more than three years for the mining tech specialist, and clearly indicates that at least one of its clients is very positive on Bitcoin's future. And, of course, the client fully intends to mint more of it.Single-purposeThis is because that rig, the Avalon A15, has been designed and built mainly tomine Bitcoin.

This week, RBC Capital noted that thehydrogenfuel cell maker could bag a big project based on a recent filing, and that has sent investors in Bloom energy into a tizzy.Image source: Getty Images.Are data centers a big market for Bloom Energy?In a research note, RBC Capital revealed that BFC Power has filed an application in Wyoming for an approval to construct a power plant with a total capacity of 900 megawatts, powered by Bloom Energy's fuel cells.Since the proposed plant will support a 1.8-gigawatt data center, RBC sees this filing as evidence of Bloom Energy's opportunities in the high-growthdata centermarket.Data centers are booming in the U.S., and they require uninterrupted supplies of power to operate their vast infrastructure and run cooling systems. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects data centers to account for almost 50% of the growth in demand for electricity through 2030.The massive need for energy is spurring growth in the overall energy sector, especially clean energy. Bloom Energy's solid-oxide fuel cells can convert alternative fuels like hydrogen and biogas into electricity on-site for uninterrupted power generation.Why Bloom Energy stock has become unstoppableWinning a data center project win in Wyoming could just be the start for Bloom Energy for many such projects in the future. Bloom Energy already has a powerful customer base. One of its most notable recent deals was to supply on-site power to tech giant Oracle's data center within 90 days. That deal was a glimpse into how quickly Bloom Energy can deploy its servers.Bloom Energy's growth story is undeniable. The company has posted record revenues and profits for three consecutive quarters and projects 2025 revenue between $1.65 billion and $1.85 billion versus $1.47 billion in 2024. With Bloom Energy planning to double capacity to 2 gigawatts by the end of 2026 to meet soaring demand for its fuel-cell servers, investors continue to pile in to the stock.",

The company's share price was up 3.3% as of 2:30 p.m. ET and had been up as much as 10.2% earlier in the daily session.Despite the absence of any big, company-specific news, Opendoor stock opened today's trading with huge gains. While the stock has given up most of the rally it saw early in the session, it's still up 417% across this year's trading as of this writing.Opendoor rises amid mixed market sentimentDespite mixed movement for the broader market today, Opendoor stock is managing to post solid gains. Even though the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was up 0.1% at the same point in the day's trading. While this setup for the broader market might normally suggest that speculative meme stocks would see some pullbacks, Opendoor and some other speculativememe stocksare still seeing bullish momentum.What's next for Opendoor?Opendoor is in the early stages of a transitional pivot that will see the company significantly trimming its employee headcount and devoting more resources to improving efficiency through artificial intelligence (AI). The strategy has the potential to significantly improve the company's margins and pave a possible pathway to profitability, but the stock continues to look like a risky play on the heels of the incredible valuation gains it's registered this year.If Opendoor's turnaround strategy proves to be effective and coincides with big improvements for user engagement across its iBuyer real estate platform, the stock could see big gains above current levels. On the other hand, there are a lot of moving pieces involved in the company's comeback strategy -- and the stock continues to look very risky.",

        "text": "Ant AnsteadDave Benett/Getty Images for Jaguar TCS RacingAnt Ansteadwas ordered to pay a hefty six-figure sum to a man who claims the television star broke his promise,Us Weeklycan exclusively report.On September 23, an Orange County Superior Court judge ordered Anstead and his business partner,Jenson Button, to pay $101,000 in damage, $17,000 in interest, and other fees for a grand total of $119,357.The judgment was entered after Anstead, 46, and his partner failed to respond to the lawsuit.The legal drama started back in July 2024 when a man namedTimothy Taskersued Anstead’s company Radford Motors (He would later add Anstead and Anstead’s business partner as personal defendants in the case).In the suit, Tasker claimed he met with Anstead on April 1, 2022. He said Anstead told him he was making and selling a new car, and only 62 would be made.Tasker said he paid a $101,000 deposit to secure one of the custom cars.Ant AnsteadMichael Kovac/Getty Images for Discovery ChannelIn court docs, Tasker said he was invited to events with Anstead and his business partners, including “time on a racetrack in the first” custom car. He said they told him the first cars would be delivered at the end of 2022 and the “remainder would be delivered throughout 2023.”In October 2022, Tasker said he told Radford he no longer wished to proceed with buying the car. He said an exec told him they understood and promised him a full refund of $101,000 would be issued no later than the end of 2022.For the next several months [Tasker’s] phone calls and e-mails regarding the return of his $101,000.00 deposit were not responded to and in September 2023, [Tasker] was advised by [a former Radford employee] that she was no longer with Radford / FCG and that [Tasker’s] information and requests had been forwarded to the new CFO” of the company.Related:Ant Anstead's Rep Shuts Down 'Disrespectful' Renee Zellweger RumorsA spokesperson for Ant Anstead has clarified the recent speculation that he and his girlfriend, Renée Zellweger, are living separately. “Sadly, the recent reports are disrespectful and misleading,” Anstead’s rep told People in a statement on Thursday, May 29, referring to the claims that the British TV host, 46, had been residing with a woman […]Tasker said he had no luck communicating with the new CFO.The suit accused Anstead and his team of not delivering a single custom car to customers.“[Tasker] is informed and believes that to date Defendants have delivered no [custom cars] and that several people had submitted deposits similar to and in excess of the deposit paid by [Tasker] and that those similarly situated individuals have likewise requested the return of their deposits without success,” the suit read.Tasker sued Radford, Anstead and his business partner for fraud, breach of contract and conversion. The suit demanded the entire $101,000 be returned. Tasker later dismissed the fraud and conversion claims against Anstead but didn’t drop the breach of contract claims.Radford Motors denied all allegations of wrongdoing. The company was dismissed from the case.A rep for Anstead tellsUs, “Mr. Anstead and Mr. Button where completely unaware of the alleged judgment. Neither was served with the complaint in the lawsuit. Neither received notice of any proposed request for entry of default or default judgment. Thus, assuming a judgment was entered … it was not pursuant to any appropriate or required due process or procedure. Mr. Anstead and Mr. Button are now consulting with legal counsel and will promptly seek to have the judgment set aside for these reasons. The judgment is not the result of any merit, but because it was obtained in secret and without the legally required notice. In fact, at this moment, Mr. Anstead and Mr. Button have still not received any alleged judgment.”Ant AnsteadDave Benett/Getty Images for Jaguar TCS RacingAsUspreviously reported, Anstead’s supercar company Radford Motorsfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcyin October 2024.Radford was a British car company that was revived by Anstead and Formula One driver Button, and various other co-owners, in 2020.Related:Renee Zellweger and Ant Anstead Attend 'Bridget Jones' Party in LondonRenée Zellweger’s beau, Ant Anstead, joined her at a party for Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy in London.

The lawsuit accused the duo of using company money to pay for personal expenses. Another lawsuit alleged Anstead and another partner mismanaged the company’s finances.On October 24, 2024, Ansteadreleased a statement stating he was “fully committed”to Radford despite the financial “challenges.”Thank You!You have successfully subscribed.Subscribe to newslettersPlease enter a valid email.SubscribeBy signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us WeeklyDealof the DayShoppers Say This ‘Flattering’ Tunic Dress is ‘Perfect’ for Wearing With Leggings — Now 33% off!View DealCheck our latest news in Google NewsFollow UsCheck our latest news in Apple NewsFollow UsRelated:Christina Haack and Ant Anstead Reunite for Son Hudson’s ‘Golden Birthday’Christina Haack and Ant Anstead came together in honor of their son Hudson’s birthday. “Hudzo explained it’s his ‘golden birthday’ as he’s 6 on the 6th!

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.They’re questions that could be asked of any number of President Donald Trump’s social media posts:Was he telling the truth before?Did he just not understand that thing that he said earlier?Is he just trolling all of us?The answer could be some combination of all three, especially in the case of Thursday’spost, and the “unprecedented opportunity” Trump says he now has to hack away at federal agencies during the government shutdown.It has to do with theman widely seenas the architect of the shutdown: Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, or as Trump described Vought in the post, “he of PROJECT 2025 Fame.”That’s the same Project 2025 that Trump repeatedly distanced himself from during last year’s presidential campaign.“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said during the presidential debate. “I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it, purposely. I’m not going to read it.”Vought’s role as one of the co-authors of Project 2025 is well-known.  The 900+ page plan published by the Heritage Foundation is a field manual for a conservative president to radically remake the US government.Vought’s expansive views on presidential power have made him the White House official most synonymous with Project 2025.Trump and Vought were set to meet on Thursday to discuss permanent cuts Trump says they could carry out during the ongoing government shutdown— cuts that were teed up by amemoVought sent last week directing federal agencies to submit detailed plans for mass layoffs.It’s the kind of government overhaul envisioned by Project 2025, which last year Trump described as something written not by past and future aides of his, but rather just by “a group of people that got together.”Some of the ideas were good, he said, and some bad.“But it makes no difference,” Trump said in the debate. “I have nothing to do – everybody knows I’m an open book. Everybody knows what I’m going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before.”It’s not surprising that candidate Trump would distance himself from the plan. It was, as CNN’s Aaron Blakenotes, an albatross. Most Americans opposed it in polling.But then, after his election, a not-so-curious thing happened. Much of Trump’s second presidency has looked like it was copied directly from Project 2025.A copy of Project 2025 is held during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, on August 21, 2024.J. Scott Applewhite/AP/FilePolicy crossoverCNN’s Steve Contorno and Casey Tolan wrote this forCNN’s Investigatesthe same month Trump took office:A CNN analysis of the 53 executive orders and actions from Trump’s first week in office found that more than two-thirds – 36 – evoke proposals outlined in “Mandate for Leadership,” Project 2025’s 922-pageblueprintfor the next Republican president. The overlap includes early steps taken by Trump to execute some of his most-touted pledges: cracking down on illegal immigration; dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; and rolling back environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration.”There is plenty of additional crossover, including skepticism of the Federal Reserve and efforts to drastically cut back on the number of federal workers.KFF did a detailed reviewof Project 2025 recommendations that suggested it was a prologue for multiple Trump policies, including funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health and the dismantling of USAID.Trump 2.0 is what Project 2025 authors set out to doIn reporting their story, Contorno and Tolan talked to Paul Dans, who oversaw Project 2025 at the Heritage Foundation, and sounded giddy in those early days of Trump 2.0.“This is exactly the work we set out to do,” Dans said in January. “It’s still in the early first stages of bearing fruit, but we wanted to make sure the president was ready to hit the ground running on day one. The rapidity and the depth of what they’ve rolled out this quickly is a testament to the work done in Project 2025 and other presidential transition projects.”Dans has since left the Heritage Foundation and is now launching a primary challenge of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina.The Heritage Foundation did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on the role Project 2025 has played in Trump’s second term.Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House on July 8.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/FilePersonnel CrossoverMany Project 2025 contributors now have jobs in Trump’s administration.There’s Vought, obviously. AndBrendan Carr, the FCC chairman who wrote the Project 2025 chapter on the FCC.Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, is listed as a contributor. So isPeter Navarro, Trump’s trade advisor, who also served in Trump’s first term and went to jail rather than testify to Congress about the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump’s SEC commissioner, the crypto enthusiastPaul Atkins, is also listed as a Project 2025 contributor.EJ Antoni is a Project 2025 contributor. After Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head following a jobs report he didn’t like earlier this year, he nominated Antoni. That nomination waswithdrawnthis week after aCNN KFile investigationuncovered Antoni’s since-deleted Twitter account that included sexually-degrading and bigoted attacks.Many authors who aren’t currently in Trump’s second administration played a role in his first.Which is all well and good. In that way, Trump’s right that he was an open book about his priorities.Trump 2.0 is what Project 2025 authors set out to doYou didn’t have to read Project 2025 to know that Trump would engage in a mass deportation effort.Trump himself recorded a series ofAgenda47campaign videos, which have been equally predictive of his second term agenda, but with much less specificity.And it’s also true that the document includes a large number of proposals Trump’s administration has left on the table.The problem for Trump, and the big question about why he would suddenly name check Project 2025, is that he promised he hadn’t read it and wouldn’t read it.President Donald Trump departs after addressing senior military officers gathered at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia, on September 30.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images/FileTrump also wants to be seen as the mastermindIt’s possible Trump did not want to be associated with Project 2025 for a much simpler reason. As anyone who has watched a televised Trump Cabinet meeting can see, he likes to be seen as the master of his kingdom. His secretaries talk about his individual greatness and his ideas.Listen to a speech these days and he’s likely to say, as he did recently to the UN General Assembly, about himself:“I’m really good at this stuff,” or “I was right about everything.”It wasn’t his administration that ended wars, as Trump likes to brag, but him alone.“I have ended seven unendable wars,” he said at the UN.He saved the economy, he’ll say. This is just a guess, but that doesn’t sound like the kind of man who wants to share credit with anyone, much less the Heritage Foundation, even if it did write the script for his second term.Donald TrumpUS electionsCongressional newsJanuary 6thSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!Follow",

        "text": "They didn’t ask for this. Two “ordinary” women whose men went to work in a coal mine one Friday and never came home. It’s 15 years since 29 workers died at Pike River. A new movie, starring Melanie Lynskey and Robyn Malcolm, tells the story of a wife and amother and the unexpected friendship that empowered an ongoing fight for justice. Anna Osborne, Sonya Rockhouse and the film’s director Robert Sarkies spoke to Kim Knight about the making ofPike Riverahead of its Greymouth premiere.The images are the colour of a coal shovel. Blue-black. Grainy-gritty. Leaked visuals from cameras inside the Pike River mine.Proof, says film director Robert Sarkies, that the families of the 29 men who died underground had been lied to.It is a pivotal moment in both the real-life and movie versions of the Pike story: the realisation there is an intact body in the mine, that fire has not turned everything to ash, that police may be able to collect forensic evidence for a criminal prosecution.Sarkies needs to show these images in his movie. Somehow, he has to recreate a photograph of a body in the mine.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Who do I talk to first? I talk to Rowdy. I ask what he thought about that, and how best to handle it. It needed to be done respectfully.”Rowdy Durbridge is the families’ representative and mining technical adviser to the team shootingPike River, the movie that premieres in Greymouth on October 13. He was also a Pike River miner, off work on the day of the explosion that killed 29 men including his son,Daniel Herk, 36.“Rowdy says to me, ‘I want to do it’. So Rowdy and I walked up to an abandoned train tunnel one day, just the two of us, and he dressed up in the Pike River gear that he hadn’t worn for, at that point, 14 years, and lay in the dirt to be photographed. To represent all of those men. His crew.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.On a Friday afternoon in 2010, just five weeks shy of Christmas, there was a methane explosion at an underground coal mine 46km northeast of Greymouth.Two men make it out alive. Loader driverRussell Smithis rescued by colleagueDaniel Rockhouse, whose father Neville is the mine’s safety and training manager. Daniel’s little brother Ben is still somewhere in the tunnels, where officials maintain the 29 workers they’ve lost contact with could be awaiting rescue at a fresh air base. For four days, families hope. Media descend from New Zealand and beyond. The mine workers include men from Australia, Scotland and South Africa. The world is watching. Just three months earlier, 33 miners trapped after a collapse at a copper and gold mine in Chile had beensuccessfully rescued after 69 days.Camera crews tape cables to footpaths, days begin and end with the thrum of helicopters. On Tuesday afternoon, families receive a text message. There is “a significant update”.Melanie Lynskey (left) and Robyn Malcolm as, respectively, Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse in a scene from the upcoming movie Pike River.Inside the Greymouth Civic Centre, Pike River’s chief executive Peter Whittall tells them gas levels inside Pike were falling and preparations were being made to enter the mine. Elation is short-lived. Seconds later, Whittall informs families there has been a second explosion. Police say it is not survivable; the operation is moving from rescue to recovery.“The scene turned to one of profound distress,” records the report of the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy.It is an outrageously sunny day. The sound from inside the Civic Centre carries through the walls and right across the carpark.Sarkies: “The description someone gave to us was that it was like an animal howling, like a sort of single being, which felt almost impossible to capture.”Anna Osborne (left), Melanie Lynskey and Sonya Rockhouse stand outside the real-life gates to the Pike River mine, during the making of a new movie about the 2010 tragedy and the ongoing fight for justice for 29 men who died.Greymouth, 2023. Sarkies knows that multiple takes of this scene will be too exhausting to shoot. He asks Rowdy and the two women who inspired this film – Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse – to speak to the crowd of almost 200 who have gathered to recreate the moment Pike families were told their men were dead.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“I just asked them to describe what that moment was like. Everyone was in tears before the scene even started, and then they sat with that description, that direct description from three people who were there. And the emotion in that room, even though it was all pretend, was visceral. That came directly from those Pike River families.”Decades of cliched media reports paint the West Coast as a region of rugged beauty, populated by resilient hard workers, who don’t trust outsiders. It’s a simplistic and stupid generalisation. But Sarkies must have wondered – how would locals react to the film crew’s presence?Pike River family members Anna Osborne, \"Rowdy\" Durbridge and Sonya Rockhouse are interviewed by Herald reporter Derek Cheng (far left) in 2019.“Certainly when you go to Greymouth and say you’re working onPike River, there’s always a kind of an intake of breath. A pause. A sort of an assessment. ‘Are you doing it the right way? Or are you here to re-traumatise us?’“What I consistently picked up was a kind of a feeling of guilt that many people have. That they could have, should have, said something. It’s like the whole mining community knew things were not good at Pike. It’s a small community, they all talk, they all understand the industry. These are not stupid people – quite the opposite – and it was a form of collective blindness, perhaps ... and the guilt that a lot of people still feel around that, it’s real, you know?“This film is going to be a hard watch for a lot of people on the Coast. I hope that, ultimately, watching it gives them some catharsis.”Pike River, written by Fiona Samuel and directed by Sarkies, starsMelanie Lynskey(Yellowjackets,Heavenly Creatures) andRobyn Malcolm(After the Party,Outrageous Fortune) as Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse – two women who lost, respectively, a husband and a son in the disaster.Sarkies, whose previous directing credits includeScarfies,Out of the BlueandConsent: The Louise Nicholas Story, says makingPike Riverchanged his world view.“I had an innate trust in authority figures. We’re a fair and egalitarian and uncorrupt society? Researching and makingPike Riverhas told me that’s all a crock of shit.”Director Robert Sarkies with actors Robyn Malcolm and Erroll Shand during the making of the movie Pike River.The Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine Tragedy notes that in the 48 days before the mine blew there had been 21 reports of methane gas levels reaching explosive volumes.A prediction the mine would be producing one million tonnes of coal a year by 2008 was “illusory” (in total, it had shipped just 42,000 tonnes). Development costs had escalated and, during 2010, Pike River Coal had raised $140 million from shareholders, was seeking another $70m and had borrowed $66m from New Zealand Oil and Gas.“There were numerous warnings of a potential catastrophe at Pike River,” the Royal Commission said. “The warnings were not heeded.”Pike River shouldn’t have happened. What the movie about Pike River shows is just how hard it has been to hold anybody to account.It’s a story that has, so far, spanned four general elections and two changes of government. Multiple Prime Ministers, politicians and high-profile leaders (including trade unionistHelen Kelly, who died in 2016) have become enmeshed in its narrative. Successive commitments to re-enter the mine and recover bodies never eventuated and in 2016, and again in 2021, families have blockaded access to Pike to prevent its permanent sealing. Most recently, boreholes were drilled and specialist cameras deployed. Police have launched a criminal investigation and are currently working with the Crown Solicitor as they consider whether to lay charges.At different times, different members of the Pike River families became the public face of grief, anger and frustration. At first, Sarkies observed from afar. He was in Invercargill, in pre-production forTwo Little Boys, when the explosion happened.“I was drawn to the humanity of it, but for a long time could not see the film in it.”But in 2016, he watched Sonya Rockhouse and Anna Osborne choosing to fight back. The women hadorchestrated a road blockadeand occupation that lasted 107 days and, ultimately, stopped concrete trucks from permanently sealing the portal to Pike.Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse in 2016, protesting the sealing of the Pike River mine. Photo / Barry Uddstrom“It suddenly felt like a story that could inspire others, a story that had to be told.”Robyn Malcolm on playing Sonya: “Sonya and Anna are national heroes but had also been through something so awful and so painful, so there was a double sense of responsibility. There was this quite weighty thing around it … then we went into the rehearsal room and we were cackling away like crazy bitches in about three minutes because they are just so funny. They put us at ease, because of course they’ve lived it, they’re no strangers to their story – we were the strangers coming into their story.”Melanie Lynskey on playing Anna: “There’s a toughness, she’s funny, very funny. And I also related to her love for Milt and her fight for justice for this man she felt this way about ... When I first read the script, I was struck by how beautiful the depiction of female friendship was. It was something I hadn’t seen too often in a screenplay. Just this wonderful friendship between these two middle-aged women who find strength in each other.”Anna and Sonya will tell you they didn’t go looking for this. But the one good thing to come from it all?“My late husband Pete has been gone for four years,” says Sonya. “One of the last things he said to me was that it gave him great comfort to know I had Anna to help look after me and be there for me, and for us to be there for each other.”They’d never met before Pike. Sonya lived in Christchurch and Anna in Ngahere in the Grey Valley. On the day of the explosion, she went straight to Pike River, demanded to be let through the gates and then refused to leave.“I remember Sonya saying she’d seen me on the TV ... and she goes ‘oh, she’s a bolshie bitch I’ll stay back from her’.”Actor Robyn Malcolm (left) and the real-life Sonya Rockhouse.Sonya: “I didn’t like having my photo taken by my mother, let alone by the world’s media. This was completely foreign to me. And to see Anna on TV? I was in awe of her. I thought, ‘wow, she’s got the balls to do that. I couldn’t do that’. I was still incredibly naive. I believed they would get them out. I believed they were still alive, or I wanted to believe they were still alive ... when I saw Anna and a few others talking in the media, I was concerned. Stupidly, I thought, ‘oh no, the Government might not do anything if we start causing waves’.“How ridiculous,” asks Sonya with the benefit of 15 years’ hindsight, “was that?”They remember their first lunch together. At Blanchfield’s Bakery they discovered matching work histories as teacher aides, a shared love of second-hand shopping – and a grief they could explain to no one but recognised in each other.Sonya: “Anna said she loved that she could talk to me about Pike and not have to feel guilty that she was talking about Pike. When I look back, in those days we were obsessed.Anna: “It controlled our lives.”Sonya: “We were consumed with anger, we were consumed with loss. They continuously promised us things and then at the eleventh hour they would go back on that promise. I mean that plays with your emotions terribly. That’s why Anna and I bonded. Because we could talk to each other.”Anna: “With Sonya I could be real. I could cry, I could scream, I could laugh, I could talk, I could do what I wanted. I felt guilty about smiling, outside of being with Sonya, because my husband was still down in that bloody shithole of a place.”They’re speaking to theHeraldvia Zoom, sharing a couch, a computer screen and, for the past nine months, Sonya’s house.Anna waves a moon-booted foot at the camera.“It’s been a hell of a year.”She is a cancer survivor (early in the making ofPike Riveractors were hired to perform a bespoke read-through of the script in case she never saw the finished version). She also has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a progressive neurological condition that affects nerves, weakens muscles and has contributed, variously, to a broken hip, wrist, foot and pelvis. Right now, Anna is recovering from foot surgery.“Sonya has been my nurse, my support person, my taxi driver, everything.”November 19 marks 15 years since the Pike River tragedy. If Anna and Sonya’s fight can be condensed into three universal goals – truth, justice and accountability – at its heart, it is still deeply and necessarily personal.The 29 men who died at Pike River, as depicted on a photo board in 2010, at a memorial garden 12 kilometres from the mine portal. Photo / Brett PhibbsMilton “Milt” Osborne, 54, was a walrus-moustachioed husband and father of two, elected unopposed to his second term as a Grey District councillor. Benjamin “Ben” Rockhouse, 21, was a son and brother, part-way through a geology degree and planning a move to Australia.Sonya: “This time of year is very difficult. I’m starting to have dreams about Ben and I get quite teary ... people think I’m staunch, I can just be driving in my car and a song will come on and it just brings me to tears. That never goes away. That anger will always be there inside me, buried, but I don’t let it consume me because there’s just no point.”Anna: “But let it be known that should we need to get our angry voices on, and our big girl pants on again, we certainly will.”They love the film and they hope it will help people understand why they’ve kept fighting.Anna says “this is our truth”.And if people don’t like it?“That’s none of our business, you know? We are authentic, honest and we’ve worked incredibly hard to get to where we are, and that shows in the movie. And it’s not over yet.”Early in this interview, they describe themselves as “ordinary” women; nothing special, they insist.Sonya: “It’s embarrassing sometimes, the recognition. This is not why we did it. For me, I was like a mother lion that lost their child. He was just a gorgeous boy and he didn’t deserve ...”Anna: “My husband ... I was so blessed to have him. My cancer had come back just before Pike and he goes ‘Anna, we’ve been through this before, and we’ll go through it again together’ and that was a month before Pike blew, and he wasn’t there.“He didn’t like Pike. He was two weeks short of walking out. For many nights, I’d close my eyes and all I could see was his body laying in a pool of water with the water dripping down and it being cold and I just didn’t want that for him. I needed him home. That was my – there was something in me – that said ‘I’ve got to do something. I cannot leave him. I’ve got to at least try’. Because he was the love of my life.”Milt is played by actor John Leigh(Shortland Street’sLionel Skeggins).“When I saw the photo, I did a double-take,” says Anna. “I don’t know how I’m going to handle this, because it really could be Milton. I don’t know if I actually want to meet him. It was really funny in the end ... he was about two feet shorter than Milt, he was a bit stockier, he walked differently, laughed differently, smiled differently.”Sonya’s son Ben was played by Richard Crouchley(Black Hands).“Ben had a very strong jawline and this guy does too. I knew instantly who he was, but we didn’t really talk ... I did struggle ... Erroll Shand who plays Pete looks nothing like him, but he’s got Pete’s nature. Very, very calm and very kind and laid-back. Erroll is very much like that. When I see him and Robyn showing affection, that gets me in the feels.”Actors Robyn Malcolm and Erroll Shand, as Sonya Rockhouse and her partner Pete, push through media in a scene from the movie Pike River.Robert Sarkies says there are challenges in turning a real-life story into a movie script. Lucy Lawless, for example, plays trade unionist Helen Kelly – the woman Sonya and Anna credit with teaching them how to fight – but her arrival in the script comes relatively late.“That would be unusual in terms of story structure. You wouldn’t normally do that if you were telling a Hollywood version of this story. We wanted to reflect the truth. There is construction, but we’re not changing essential truths. I think the awareness that one day we would be showing the film to the families ...”Sarkies compiled a 200-page visual document that formed the basis of the film’s aesthetic. There are scenes that every Coaster will recognise. Smoked chicken pizza on a blackboard menu. That particular shade of blue house paint. Gumboots at the door and grown men with lunch packs because there are no cafes or pie shops when your workplace is kilometres underground.“We were pretty obsessive about authenticity. If you get the details right, and just connect them with the truth of the story, then the whole thing just has this air of authenticity,” says Sarkies.Why make a film when everybody knows how that terrible day ended?“The Pike River story is so confusing that people, 15 years later, aren’t quite sure what to think about it. They just know there was an explosion and a bunch of angry families, and they’re not quite sure why they’re angry or why they would want their men out of the mine, aren’t the men just skeletons now? All completely valid questions,” says Sarkies.A film, he says, has the capacity to get under your skin. To answer those questions in a “felt” way.“It enables you to walk in the shoes of those people and experience what that must have been like.“What we don’t know is what those families went through and how they fought together to create changes ... so that evidence could be found to potentially bring people who are responsible to justice.“I hope it will inspire someone, other New Zealanders, to fight when they know they are facing an injustice or a wrong. I think the story proves that if you fight, you can win. And that’s rare.”Pike River’s red carpet, invite-only premiere takes place at Greymouth’s Regent Theatre on October 13.

        "text": "A man who disrupted a college classroom to yell slurs and give Nazi salutes learned about the paradox of tolerance the hard way.This week, multiple videos have been circulating showing the saga that ensued after a man later identified as Sam Polyak interrupted a psychology lecture at the University of Washington.According toone student’s account, the first time he entered the lecture hall, he gave a Nazi salute and used a racial slur. But he then returned roughly 40 minutes later to cause more trouble.“He came in again and started calling us degenerates for learning the material, a bunch of slurs, basically a lot of harmful rhetoric,” Ashlyn Anderson, a student from the class, toldKING 5. “A lot of us weren’t going to tolerate that.”University of Washington students chase down Nazi disrupterAnd that’s where the viral videos kick in. One clip shows Polyak standing at the front of the classroom while the students overwhelming boo him and tell him to get out. Two students finally get up and chase him out, and others start to follow them, one by one.After that, Polyak can be seen outside, filming the throng of students as they continue to yell at him to leave. A woman who appears to be the teacher takes the lead, stepping out in front of her class, flipping Polyak off, and leading the march towards him. The video from Polyak’s perspective shows just how many of the students were gathered to see him off.Polyak can be heard complaining that there are 30 of them and only one of him (although the actual ratio seems significantly higher), and claiming, “You keep teaching these kids degenerate nonsense.”Eventually, Polyak began to run, although the crowd caught up to him and reportedly surrounded him until security arrived to escort him off campus.What happened to Sam Polyak?One student is seen pepper-spraying Polyak before the chase started, and another appeared to grab at his hair when they finally caught up to him. Somebody pushed the guy grabbing at his hair away, and after that, they all simply stood in a circle around him and waited.It’s unclear if anything else happened in the brief moments Polyak was off camera. He appeared unharmed, but later toldKING 5that he had cuts and bruises.@elajulianci hope mrs nicole is okay (guys im trying to post the storytime but it keeps deleting but the storytime should be on reddit)#PROTECTHER#GirlBoss#udub#universityofwashington#uw♬ original sound – murph mixes🧑🏼💿“Are you guys f**king serious?” he protested. “I thought you guys were the party of peace. What the f**k is this?”Unfortunately for Polyak, just because a group of people advocates tolerance for all doesn’t mean they won’t stand up to somebody disrupting the peace with their own violent and degrading rhetoric.That’s not how it works.According toKING 5, Polyak copped to being a neo-Nazi and said he wandered on to campus and into the lecture just “to troll.”People celebrate shutting down NazisIn this particular moment in time, seeing people stand up to Nazi garbage and refuse to just turn the other cheek or agree to disagree is rather refreshing. Despite the occasional disclaimers that violence is never the answer (and the occasional tears from Nazi sympathizers), the overwhelming response from folks online was to cheer on these students for how they handled things.@hunta_sanThat professor STOOD ON BUSINESS#huntasan#gamermoment#04#uw#collegelife♬ original sound – hunta_san“the discipline of this crowd is incredible to hold back from just beating his a**. they just form a wall and humiliate him until he gets escorted off campus. absolute master class”“FAFO never hit so hard”The University of Washington confirmed that Polyak, who is not a student, has been banned from campus, and criminal charges against him may follow.“The incident on Wednesday in which an individual interrupted a lecture in Kane Hall while apparently making Nazi salutes and hurling insults at the instructor and students is completely unacceptable,”a spokesperson said. “The UW is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment and will continue to do everything possible to ensure our community’s safety.”The internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Integrating Claude with Slack gives the chatbot permission to access threads in a user's workspace channels, as well as their direct messages and shared files -- but only those that they have direct access to.Claude in Slack is available now through the Slack Marketplace, which is accessible to teams subscribed to paid Slack plans.New Slack connectorClaude can also now be integrated with Slack directly through aconnectorin its chat interface, via the settings menu (two horizontal lines with overlaying circles), which enables it to access users' past Slack messages to contextualize its responses to queries.Also:Consumers more likely to pay for 'responsible' AI tools, Deloitte survey saysA user might prompt Claude at the beginning of the workweek, for example, to search through their recent Slack messages to figure out which tasks they should prioritize and draft emails to colleagues to schedule any necessary meetings.The Slack connector is available to Claude Team and Enterprise customers. Account admins must first enable the connector before teams can access it through the chatbot's settings tab.Agents in the workplaceThe fusion between Claude and Slack is part of a more general trend throughout the tech industry to equip businesses with AI agents that are widely marketed as virtual assistants specializing in mundane but time-consuming tasks.Also:I love Slack's new Lists feature so much I wish it was a standalone app\"Every company is on its way to becoming an agentic enterprise, where AI agents work hand-in-hand with humans. Partnering with Anthropic to integrate Claude into Slack and Slack context into Claude accelerates that journey -- bringing best-in-class AI directly into the flow of work,\" Rob Seaman, Chief Product Officer at Slack, said in a statement.Want more stories about AI?Sign up for AI Leaderboard, our weekly newsletter.Slack jumped aboard the AI-powered productivity bandwagon with the July launch of asuite of new features, including real-time translation, for its Pro, Enterprise+, and Business+ plans.More accessible AI toolsAI developers have been using popular third-party apps as entry points to get their AI tools into the hands of as many users as possible. While some people are devoted enough to Claude to go through the trouble of downloading the app or bookmarking it on their laptop, it takes less effort to tag it in a Slack message, opening the door to more widespread use.Also:Snowflake adds MCP support, new AI suite for financial servicesAnthropic also recently integrated Claude with a host of other popular apps like Stripe, Canva, and Asana through a\"directory\" of third-party connectors.In a similar move, AI startup Perplexity launched anEmail Assistanttool last month that can connect directly to Gmail or Microsoft to handle tasks like summarizing lengthy email threads.Artificial IntelligenceI retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even lessHow to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub CopilotThis is the fastest local AI I've tried, and it's not even close - how to get itIs ChatGPT Plus still worth $20 when the free version offers so much - including GPT-5?I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even lessHow to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub CopilotThis is the fastest local AI I've tried, and it's not even close - how to get itIs ChatGPT Plus still worth $20 when the free version offers so much - including GPT-5?Editorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity GuidelinesRelatedChatGPT is crushing rivals in the AI chatbot race by all measures - but for how long?Claude Sonnet 4.5 could be your next breakthrough coding tool - how to access it todayChatGPT will let your team collaborate via 'shared projects' - and other work-friendly updates",

        "text": "LifestyleForbesLifeLuxe Design’s Approach To Inspired Living, From Vision To HomeSanam Zubli and Jen Cossidente found their career second acts by crafting interiors that feel effortless, personal and beautifully lived in.ByCaroline Tell,Contributor.Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.Caroline Tell is a New York-based travel and lifestyle writer.Follow AuthorOct 03, 2025, 03:58pm EDTUpdated Oct 3, 2025, 04:17pm EDTShareSaveCommentSanam Zubli’s spark came while building her family’s Long Island home. What began as a practical project — managing contractors, choosing finishes, making countless decisions — became a revelation, unlocking a creative drive she hadn’t fully tapped before. Jen Cossidente’s path was different but no less certain. After years in the corporate side of fashion, she quickly realized stability couldn’t compete with her passion for design. To her, a well-conceived space isn’t just beautiful — it carries emotion, creating calm, joy, and belonging. She wanted to give that feeling to others, and design was the way.A chance meeting at the Metropolitan Institute of Design brought Zubli and Cossidente together. Soon after, they launchedLuxe Design, embracing the idea of a second act and stepping off the traditional path to follow their instincts. In doing so, they’ve built careers rooted in passion, purpose and the belief that home should be as inspiring as it is personal.You both came to design from very different careers — what drew you to interiors, and why did it feel like the right second act?Jen Cossidente and Sanam ZubliLuxe DesignSanam:Right out of NYU Stern I went into book publishing, and for five years I loved being part of that world. But once I got married and started a family, I stepped away to focus on raising our kids. When it came time for us to build a larger home, I naturally took the lead on the design and construction process — every detail, every decision. I was surprised by how much I loved it; the process completely invigorated me and unlocked a creative side I hadn’t fully tapped into before.Jen:I always had a love for design, but like many teens, I chose the practical path—business degree, corporate job, steady paycheck. Within two years, I realized I couldn’t keep ignoring the urge for more purpose. For me, finding that purpose was easy: I wanted to design spaces that make people feel something the moment they walk in.How did those first conversations at the Metropolitan Institute of Design spark the idea for Luxe Design?Sanam:Those first conversations weren’t so much about launching a business as they were about discovering a true partnership. Despite being at different stages in life, we immediately clicked — not only in terms of design aesthetic, but also in how we thought about business, entrepreneurship, and personal growth. The synergy was undeniable. From there, Luxe Design didn’t feel like a calculated decision — it felt like the natural extension of a partnership that had already taken shape.A dining room by Luxe DesignLuxe DesignLuxe Design is built around the philosophy of creating “the backdrop for life’s best moments.” What does that mean to each of you personally?Sanam:As a mom of four, I’ve learned to see our everyday routines and milestones as chapters in a larger family story. And the setting for those stories is always our home. To me, creating ‘the backdrop for life’s best moments’ means designing spaces that honor both the ordinary and the extraordinary. A simple Monday night dinner, for example, can feel just as meaningful as a milestone birthday when it unfolds in a space that reflects who you are and what you value.Jen:My aunt had a saying: ‘Live a Beautiful Life.’ Before she passed, she embodied that phrase in every way. It wasn’t just about dressing beautifully or keeping a perfect home—it was about loving fearlessly, savoring experiences, and making memories that would last a lifetime. That’s what we want for our clients. Everyone deserves a home that supports them in creating those kinds of moments.How do you define luxury today, and how do you make it feel livable rather than intimidating?A bedroom by Luxe DesignLuxe DesignJen:For us, luxury isn’t about price tags or rarity — it’s about creating an elevated experience that feels both beautiful and deeply personal. True luxury lies in the layers of intentional design that transform a space you might overlook into something meaningful. Think of that awkward nook that suddenly becomes the coziest reading corner with a plush cushion and perfect lighting. That’s luxury: design that enhances how you live every single day.Families are central to your work. How does designing for real life — kids, gatherings, daily routines — shape your approach?Jen:Designing for real life means thinking beyond the here and now. Of course, we incorporate performance fabrics, durable materials, and scratch-resistant finishes—but just as important is anticipating what our clients will need as their families grow. How will the space work when young kids become teenagers? How can it transition to serve them in the future? Sanam’s experience raising four children, two of whom are already in college, has given us a firsthand perspective on how needs evolve.Where do you find inspiration outside of interiors — in fashion, art, travel, or elsewhere?Sanam:We of course find inspiration in fashion, art, and travel, but surprisingly our biggest inspiration comes from our clients’ stories. We spend time getting to know them—where their families are from, the trips they take, and how they want to live—so we can translate those details into the design. That’s what allows us to create interiors that are not only beautiful, but also truly reflective of who they are.You’ve said design can change the way a family spends time together. Can you share a project where you saw that transformation happen?Jen:A family of four came to us to design an additional living space. They already had two TV rooms, so our goal was to create something different—a room where the family could come together completely unplugged, with no phones, TVs, or iPads. The result was a cozy library fully equipped with a chess table, custom built-ins to store board games, and a sofa nook with reading lights and channeled upholstery running all the way to the ceiling for a cocoon-like effect. The client’s reaction said it all: ‘I can’t believe I got the kids in there without their iPads—they love it.’What lessons from your first careers in publishing and fashion have proven most valuable as design entrepreneurs?Sanam:In publishing, one of the most valuable lessons I learned early on is that every person is a brand. The way you present yourself, whether through how you speak, how you dress, or how you carry yourself in a room, tells a story about who you are and what you stand for. You cannot take that for granted, and it’s something I often remind my own kids of as they prepare for college and professional life.Jen:My time in fashion taught me how critical communication is—not just timely communication, but effective communication. As an assistant buyer, I reported to four different higher-ups, each with their own preferences. I had to keep everyone aligned, even when they were saying different things. That skill has been invaluable in design. A workroom creating custom window treatments, for example, needs very different information than a client does, and it’s our job to make sure both are crystal clear. Navigating those layers of communication is what keeps projects running smoothly.When someone walks into a Luxe Design home, what do you hope they immediately feel?Jen:When you walk into a Luxe Design home, we want you to feel immediately welcomed. Our spaces are designed to impress, but never to intimidate. Go ahead—sink into the sofa, pile on top of the pillows, or pick up a pot and start cooking. Each home tells our client’s story, and our hope is that you feel both at ease and intrigued to learn more.Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions",

Spoiler alert: she’s still not a huge fan.RelatedAriana Grande Is ‘Disheartened’ After Elvira Calls Her Out for Rude Encounter, Explains a Different Side of the StoryThe White House Responds to Ariana Grande Criticizing Trump’s Second Term: ‘Save Your Tears’No ‘Good’ Deed Goes Unpunished for Ariana Grande’s Glinda in Final ‘Wicked: For Good’ Trailer“I told a story that really happened,” Elvira began. “She did it. I wasn’t making it up. It was very offensive.”“I had all the celebrities who I had ever come to my show — and there was a ton — were always gracious and kind … she was not,” she continued. “I’m sorry to say that. It’s disappointing when you hear things like that, and learn things like that. It’s sad.”The performer’s comments come almost a full year after she publicly recounted meeting Grande approximately seven years prior at an event. “She brought 20 guests … she comes backstage, and she asks if I could take pictures with all of her friends and relatives she brought,” Elvira recalled at the time. “I take a picture with every single one of them. I sign autographs for every single one of them. Then I say to her, ‘Can we take a photo together?’ She goes, ‘Nah, I don’t really do that.’”Shortly after that story came out, theWickedactress spoke up to explain that she remembered things happening a little differently. “I’m so disheartened to see this,” Grande wrote on Instagram in October 2024. “I actually don’t even remember getting the chance to meet you, because I had an anxiety attack and to my memory, left before the rest of my family … but if I’m misremembering this moment, I sincerely apologize for offending you so.”While speaking toEW, however, Elvira voiced her opinion that Grande’s words didn’t do much to smooth things over. “What’s the word? You know, where you do something, but you really have other thoughts in mind?” she told the publication of the two-time Grammy winner’s apology. “Like, ‘Thank you, not really, thank you.'”“After that response from her, no, I just let the whole thing drop,” she added. “I think when you’re young, and you’re in show business — well, if you last in show business for any amount of time and are still famous — you do learn a lot of lessons along the way, and you get a little more humble. So hopefully that will happen with her.”Grande has certainly accomplished much since the incident in question. In addition to releasing albumsThank U, Next,PositionsandEternal Sunshine— all three of which topped theBillboard 200— the musician also snagged her dream role as Glinda in theWickedfilms, earning an Oscar nod for best supporting actress last year. The franchise’s second installment,Wicked: For Good, premieres in theaters this November.Get weekly rundowns straight to your inboxSign UpWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?Get in the know onVisit Billboard Pro for music business news",

        "text": "President Donald Trump is investigating how to cut federal aid fromPortland,Oregon, due to the city’s soft stance on violence by “Antifa and otherleft-wing domestic terrorists.”“I just spoke with the president about this, and he has directed his team here at the White House to begin reviewing aid that can potentially be cut in Portland,” presidential press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Friday’s briefing. “We will not fund states that allow anarchy.”Leavitt announced an additional surge of federal resources to Portland immediately, including enhanced Customs and Border Protection andImmigration and Customs Enforcementresources.“Law and order will prevail,” she said, “and President Trump will make sure of it.”Last weekend, Trump ordered troops to protect Portland, Oregon, and anyICEfacilities threatened by Antifa.“President Trump will end the radical Left’s reign of terror in Portland once and for all,” Leavitt said. “The president has directed Secretary [of War Pete] Hegseth to provide all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland and any ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa and other left-wing domestic terrorists.”She decried “left-wing anarchy” that “has been destroying this great American city for years, leaving police officers battered, citizens terrorized, and business properties damaged.”“Since early June alone, Antifa terrorists have laid siege to the ICE field office in South Portland,” she said, adding that the rioters used a stop sign as a battering ram, and hurled explosives and other projectiles at law enforcement. Protesters even rolled out a mock guillotine in front of the ICE facility, she said.Related posts:Trump Blames Biden Admin Open Borders for Texas BeheadingSCOOP: Trump Official Reveals Criteria for Investigating Left-Wing NGOs After Kirk AssassinationBREAKING: Trump Selects Next ‘War Ravaged’ City for Troop DeploymentRylie Doughertysays:October 3, 2025 at 4:06 pmThere is definately a lot to find out about this subject.

On Saturday, October 4, Eakins Oval will transform into a food-lovers’ hub forPepsi Philly Eats Fest. The first-of-its-kind festival is a celebration of the city’s most beloved dishes, its music scene, and the sports culture that defines it.The free, one-day event runs from 12:00–5:00 p.m. and gathers nine standout restaurants in one spot, each serving signature dishes that show why “Local Eats Deserve Pepsi.” The lineup includes sausage sandwiches, cheesesteaks, crabfries, and Caribbean comfort food all paired with an ice-cold Pepsi. For fans of flavor and football, it’s the ultimate pregame to Sunday’s Eagles matchup.A Food Lineup That Goes Beyond CheesesteaksPhilly’s food scene has never been one-note, and the roster of vendors reflects its diversity.Café Carmela,Chickie’s & Pete’s,Curly’s Comfort Food,Jacobs Northwest,Oregon Steaks,Philip’s Steaks,Rocco’s Italian Sausage,The Flavor Spot, andThree Monkeys Cafewill each serve their most crowd-pleasing dishes.For Chef Tanesha Trippett of Jacobs Northwest, that means a Southern-inspired chicken on a stick, which is a deep-fried trio of chicken, pickles, and potatoes.“It is budget friendly and delicious, plus it works well at events and festivals,” she said. “It’s also a southern offering and my goal is to make southern food Philly ‘jawns.’”Three Monkeys Cafe, which just celebrated its 25th anniversary, is bringing it’s popular cheesesteak eggrolls to the festivities. “They’re our top seller every year, we make them ourselves and put a lot of pride into them,” said Director of Administration Dottie Fanning. “A slightly different take on the Philadelphia classic.”MORE FOR YOUFor both restaurants, the opportunity is about visibility as much as it is about feeding the crowd.“Events like Pepsi Philly Eats Fest bring awareness to small, local businesses because they put us in front of potential customers we wouldn’t normally be able to reach with the marketing we could afford or have access to,” Trippett explained.Fanning agreed. “Food festivals like Pepsi Philly Eats Fest help shed light on many different businesses from all over the city that might not get the same attention as some of the others.”Music, Sports, and City SpiritIf the food is the main attraction, the stage promises just as much energy. Hip-hop duo Clipse will headline, joined by Grammy-nominated R&B star Ari Lennox and Philly’s own Freeway, who brings both hometown pride and a history of community philanthropy.Adding to the Philly flavor, former Eagles running back Brian Westbrook will make a special appearance, alongside the team’s cheerleaders, drumline, and iconic mascot SWOOP.The mix of food, music, and football is no accident, said Scott Finlow, Chief Marketing Officer for PepsiCo Away From Home.“Pepsi, food, and football go hand in hand, and Philadelphia’s culture is built on unapologetic passion for its food, its sports teams, and more,” he said. “Pepsi Philly Eats Fest is meant to be more than just a food event but a true celebration of the city’s culture, its impact, and the people who love it.”Support for Local RestaurantsThe Flavor Spot brings bold, hometown tastes to Pepsi Philly Eats Fest.PEPSI®Beyond the party atmosphere, Pepsi is using the festival to highlight itsLocal Eats Deserve Pepsi initiative, which has already supported more than 75,000 small restaurants nationwide.“These are businesses that often serve as cornerstones of their communities but don’t always get the same visibility or opportunities as their larger competitors,” Finlow explained. “Our role is to be a partner that supports their business growth by providing the resources they need to help diners discover them, plus keep them coming back.”That support can mean everything from public relations guidance to professional food photography; tools that many neighborhood restaurants don’t have access to. For Philadelphia businesses like Jacobs Northwest and Three Monkeys Cafe, the exposure is a chance to reach diners outside their immediate neighborhood.Extending the Celebration Beyond PhillyFor food lovers outside the city, Pepsi has teamed up with DoorDash to make Philly flavors available nationwide. On Sunday, October 5, customers can get $15 off orders that include a Pepsi-Cola beverage from select local restaurants serving Philly favorites. It’s a way to extend the reach of the festival far beyond the steps of the Art Museum.A Festival Rooted in Local FlavorAt its core, the event is designed to shine a spotlight on Philadelphia as a food city, not just a cheesesteak town.“Philadelphia has had a thriving food scene for a very long time,” said Fanning. “While it does get recognition, it doesn’t always get the same grace as New York or other larger metropolitan areas.”Trippett added,“Pepsi Philly Eats Fest helps to showcase the diversity in our city by offering traditional foods that complement different regions of the world. This is what I love most about the Philly food scene.”With local pride on the plate, a national stage for its restaurants, and a soundtrack that spans hip-hop to R&B, Pepsi Philly Eats Fest is set to be a full-throttle celebration of Philadelphia’s flavor and culture.Editorial StandardsReprints & PermissionsLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video",

        "lead": "Anti-piracy strategies targeted at consumer-facing pirate streaming sites are not always the best solution. That claim appears in a beIN/Miramax submission to the USTR, as input for its 2025 review of notorious markets. A more effective alternative would targ…",
        "text": "For those interested in how policy takes shape under pressure from a constantly adapting piracy landscape, submissions to the USTR for its annual review of ‘notorious markets’ often carry clues on the performance of current strategies.Beyond the work of the USTR, some issues raised in submissions aren’t easily fixed but can develop into topics for wider discussion. A joint submission by broadcasting group beIN and Miramax, a company jointly owned by beIN and Paramount Global, recommends the addition of four relatively low-profile pirate entities to the 2025 list.While the USTR could justify their inclusion based on the submission, another component that we’ll address in a moment seems likely to spark wider discussion. As beIN informs the USTR, underlying problems in some regions render enforcement all but impossible, and since other anti-piracy measures are no longer considered effective, options are limited.Persistent ThreatsIn common with previous submissions, beIN begins by calling out countries where IPTV piracy continues to cause significant issues.From the tone of the report, some Iraqi internet service providers have now fully embraced the opportunity to add value to sales of basic bandwidth by bundling “virtually unlimited” access to pirated content. Calling out MyTV+, Vodu, Veo, Cinemana, Cee, and Cinema Box by name, beIN stresses that these aren’t independent services; they’re an integral part of the ISPs’ subscription broadband packages.“The biggest offenders are Newroz Telecom / Fast Group and Earthlink Group, with additional facilitation by Shams Telecom, Halasat and HRiNS. These ISPs are not merely tolerating piracy but are directly responsible for operating and monetizing it,” beIN explains.In the north of the country, services including Chaloos, Mediastar and Forever TV remain persistent threats, with the latter presumably able to turn a profit on subscriptions as low as $38 per year. Family Box also receives a prominent mention as a particularly troublesome supplier; around a third of pirated beIN streams display the Family Box logo in the corner.More generally, beIN says there’s a problem that persists across much of the MENA region, regardless of borders. Piracy has become so entrenched it’s conducted out in the open; from sales of Spider-branded devices in Jordan to purchases of Chinese pirate devices from UAE’s Dragon Mart, the effect of legal action is temporary at best.The Enforcement/Evasion CycleThe USTR’s focus in 2025 is piracy of live sports broadcasts and on that front, beIN and Miramax offered information that they believe the USTR will find useful.In our view, while much attention is often directed to individual websites offering pirate content, this is not always the best way to seek to tackle the problem. The website landscape can be very fluid, with new domains and websites continuously being created, often in order to evade enforcement. Regrettably, the structure and nature of the internet means this is relatively easy, and the task of enforcing against individual websites extremely challenging.While beIN refrains from using the term ‘site-blocking’, the appearance of new domains and the continuous spawning of new websites are classic signs of blocking countermeasures.During the summer, DAZN obtained perhaps the most aggressive blocking injunction ever issued by a court, with rules of engagement heavily in favor of DAZN. It’s likely the campaign caused disruption but exactly how much is hard to say. DAZN blocked over 500 domains in a matter of weeks, but the job still wasn’t finished.Time to RefocusThe alternative proposed by beIN isn’t new, and as an enforcement measure, it faces its own set of challenges.“Companies known as ‘hosting providers’ or ‘dedicated server providers’ are central to the piracy problem because they make it possible for pirates to operate online. Without such hosting, pirates would be unable to distribute their content. beIN, like many owners of live sports broadcast content, routinely monitors the internet to identify these providers by using publicly available databases managed by regional internet authorities,” beIN reports.Once beIN identifies a platform offering its pirated channels illegally, the company contacts the platform’s hosting provider, sends a takedown notice, and those respectful of the DMCA usually process them. The problem for beIN is that among pirate sites there has been a “huge shift” towards so-called ‘off-shore’ or ‘bulletproof’ hosting providers that do little or nothing in response to takedown notices.For background, the image below supplied by beIN shows a typical live sports streaming piracy setup.In this example, beIN says the Piracy-as-a-Service platforms in the center (red box) supplied MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL content to over 270 pirate websites, together generating 3.2 billion visits between July 2024 and June 2025.These PaaS providers are the unseen enablers, offering bad actors the technical infrastructure to deliver infringing content. Their services, which may include the direct supply of video streams, the use of ‘off-shore’ hosting to evade abuse complaints, and the constant acquisition of new domain names to bypass site-blocking, are designed to ensure a high degree of anonymity and secrecy. This makes it difficult to enforce against and to trace those responsible for tens of thousands of infringements.The PaaS platforms identified by beIN (ePlayer, Aliez, WG/OBStream, and Cast/Hoca) are not as widely known as the branded user-facing sites they serve, but their contribution to the piracy ecosystem is significant in this case. The problem for beIN is the unresponsive nature of the off-shore/bulletproof providers that host the PaaS platforms (beIN’s examples below), in particular their tendency to disregard DMCA notices.Criticism of RIPE NCCIn a ‘normal’ environment, beIN would be able to identify the hosting provider by its ASN and IP addresses which are allocated by an organization called RIPE (RIPE NCCin Europe).If the hosting provider was Amazon, for example, beIN could obtain the specific contact information held by RIPE NCC (most likely after obtaining a court order), put pressure on Amazon, and then the PaaS platform would probably get taken down. In extreme circumstances beIN might even sue, or at least that would be an option.“Poor governance and a non-existent know your customer”In the case of off-shore/bulletproof providers, beIN says that identifying the owner of an ASN using information held by RIPE NCC can prove impossible.“RIPE NCC requests its members or those who use RIPE NCC resources to provide accurate contact information. Some rogue providers abuse this system by posting false or incomplete information. This prevents rights owners and authorities from reaching them or successfully sending takedown notices,” beIN explains.Inaccurate information can include fake or unmonitored email addresses, false business addresses or shared locations with many tenants. This ultimately makes it impossible for beIN to identify the owners of off-shore hosting companies. If it’s unable to do that, targeting the operators of the PaaS platforms becomes impossible too.“In other words, the very concept of an offshore or bulletproof hosting provider seeks to rely on the ease by which this registration system can be misused through the provision of false or incomplete information,” the company adds.beIN’s Lee Kent and Andrew Willatt from the Premier League aired their grievances at the RIPE 89 event last year. In a full presentation(pdf)they laid out how RIPE NCC and its community could help.Theofficial minutesare inconclusive, but in light of beIN’s submission to the USTR, it’s likely that the parties still don’t see eye to eye.The beIN and Miramax submission to the USTR is availablehere(pdf)",

One blasted, “Spending 30 grand on a six-inch purse is diabolical. You could sell a rich person a dollar general bag if you put a big price tag on it.”“Tone deaf and honestly, idk WTF else we need to revolutionise,” said another.A third summed it up bluntly: “I could do so much more with that money.”Some kept it cheeky. “I picked up some new sweatpants from Costco last week,” one user cracked.Another sarcastically added, “I too am missing the blue jacket from Hermès, we have so much in common.”Becca Bloom may have millions of followers and fine china pricier than your rent — but TikTok thinks her luxe life is nothing to toast.Tiktok/@beccaxbloomAnd one commenter simply sighed: “Oh to be this Wealthy.”And TikTok’s not done dragging Becca Bloom — and now the critiques are getting sharper.This week, creator @1ilyp00h posted atakedown, declaring: “Becca Bloom’s account is weird and unnerving to me, not just because of the exorbitant wealth that she’s flaunting with the wealth disparity that exists in this country, besides that, she is just so uninspired with the way she uses her wealth.”In her caption, she doubled down, writing: “There’s nothing interesting about [Bloom’s] life beyond her extreme wealth, which she spends in the most predictable, uninspired ways.”@1ilyp00hnot to mention that the only instance (that i’m aware of) of her donating any money was through a paid partnership with a brand, and it wasn’t even her own money😭#beccabloom♬ original sound – billy newspaperViewers chimed in with their own digs. “Boring is an understatement,” one scoffed, while another joked, “Let them UNBOX cake.”And, of course, the nickname stuck: “The Marie Antoinette of TikTok.”Another creator, Hana Horvath (@yourbrainonmoney), joined in on the discussion, noting in a recentvideothat Bloom “is just one of many creators that produce this kind of content.”Horvath, who framed the clip around the rise of “RichTok” — where creators shamelessly flaunt their fortunes — warned the trend is “so dangerous” for impressionable viewers, since it “warps our baseline of what we think is normal.”@yourbrainonmoneylet’s talk about#richtok♬ original sound – Hanna Horvath, CFP®Andnormal is shifting fast.Turns out it’s not just Gen Z dreaming of ring lights and brand deals — nearly 60% of middle-aged users say they’d happily ditch their day jobs to become full-time influencers, compared to just half of 20-somethings, aspreviously reported byThe Post.Even if they’re not ready to walk out on the boss, two-thirds of social media users admit they’d gladly cash a check to hawk products online, as per a recentstudy by IZEA Worldwide Inc.Influencers are also 1.5 times more likely to be self-employed than casual posters — meaning more freedom to curate feeds instead of clocking in.But the glamorous life isn’t always paying the bills. Nearly 6 in 10 influencers still work full-time, and just over half have ever been paid by a brand.Bloom’s riches may sparkle online, but critics say her “tone deaf” flaunting — as seen in her latest unboxing video — is leaving a sour taste.Tiktok/@beccaxbloomStill, the allure is undeniable. “This research underscores the seismic shift in career aspirations driven by the thriving creator economy,” IZEA CEO Ted Murphy said in a statement.“Nearly half of young consumers are willing to leave traditional employment to pursue full-time influencer roles, demonstrating the allure and impact of this industry.”",

Lovers of some hardware will be happy to know that the new, tradition-honoring Logger features nickel eyelets, which contrast impeccably with the richness of its waxed leather.More of a 1930s fan? There’s theEngineer Bootfor you: the closest equivalent to a traditional riding boot (gleaming buckle and all) in this collection. Indeed, it was first introduced as a style for horseback riders and hunters in 1936. A few years after that, the shoe came into favor with railroad engineers, who likely appreciated its seamless, pull-on design, roomy toe box, and ground-gripping outsole. The pre-war boot is reimagined now with Black Klondike leather, whose slightly mattified finish makes it a sight to behold. Whether you don it at the stables or on city streets, know that the shoe’s utility will be well-matched by its ability to make a style statement.Advertisement for the original Logger Boot, pulled from Red Wing Shoe Co.’s archive.Courtesy Red Wing Shoe Company Corporate ArchivesLast but certainly not least is Red Wing Shoe Co.’sPecos, derived from a shoe born in 1953 that was used by cowboys as a roper boot — which needs to have a shorter shaft, rounder toe, and lower heel than a standard cowboy boot, so as to be functional not only on horseback but also during long stretches of time on your feet. Like the Engineer, the Pecos hopped industries and was soon embraced by Texas’ oil workers, a sign of its sheer versatility. Paying homage to this history, the 2025 iteration’s Chemigum outsole is oil-resistant, and its roughout leather is much more resilient than the comparable suede, though with a similar underhand feel. You’ll quickly appreciate the Pecos’ almond-shaped toe that nonetheless leaves ample room for your foot, as well as its leather comfort pad that doles out added cushioning.Engineer getting fitted for Red Wing Shoe Co.’s eponymous boot style, which was first introduced as a shoe for horseback riders and hunters in 1936.Courtesy Red Wing Shoe Company Corporate ArchivesThe best part about this capsule just might be the fact that it’s making us excited for the year 2145. The Red Wing Shoe Co., after all, celebrated the launch by burying a (literal) time capsule outside of its Minnesota headquarters. Inside? All three of the boot styles, alongside a product manifest and brand artifacts — all buried in a container designed to withstand the elements, much like its contents.“The act of burial is both a tribute to the past and a promise to the future, proof that Red Wingbootsand the values behind them will remain relevant for generations to come,” the brand states.Shoptheshoes, laden with significance, and watch as they make each ofyourfuture footfalls sturdier.Sign up forWWD Shop’s newsletterto get the scoop on the best in beauty and style with in-depth reviews of exciting new releases and buyer’s guides to find the products you need to try ASAP.Why Trust Footwear NewsFor more than 75 years, Footwear News has been the shoe authority.

        "title": "Who gets back pay and who doesn't after a government shutdown?",
        "lead": "Furloughed federal workers are entitled to back pay by law, but contractors are not. Here's who gets paid and who doesn't.",
        "text": "No new jobs data as shutdown continuesNo new jobs data as government shutdown continues06:16When thegovernment shuts down, many federal workers go without paychecks, whether they are deemed essential and required to show up for work or whether they're furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.Such employees are by law entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached, but independent contractors who sell goods or services to the U.S. government are not similarly protected.Dan Koh, the former chief of staff at the Labor Department under President Biden, recently said on his podcast that workers employed by companies that have contracts with the government are hurt in a shutdown.That's because there's no guarantee such workers will be paid once the government reopens, according to Koh. But even federal workers who eventually receive back pay can suffer during a shutdown, as many of them live paycheck to paycheck, he added.\"Even if you are entitled to back pay, a lot of people can't go even a couple of days without their regularly scheduled paycheck,\" he told CBS News. \"If you have to pay your subway fare, for gas, if something breaks in your home, and you're not getting paid, it places extreme stress on government employees,\" he said.Members of Congress and the Presidentcontinue to receive paychecksduring a shutdown.Who gets paid and who does not?Federal workers, includingboth furloughed and excepted government employees, receive back pay under a federal law guaranteeing that they'll eventually be made whole.TheGovernment Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019states that workers who are furloughed due to a lapse in federal funding, as well as excepted workers who are considered essential and required to work without being paid, all receive back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"By contrast, workers and businesses that contract with the government are not similarly guaranteed delayed compensation.Roughly 620,000 people, or about 28% of federal workers, are projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an Oxford Economics analysis of government data. Additionally, millions of private sector workers who are supported by federal grants and contracts could see their pay be affected by the shutdown, according to the economic advisory firm.The group estimates that the government supports up to an additional 10 million private workers through federal grants and contracts.In 2024, the federal government spent about $755 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\"The government is the largest buyer of goods and services, so when they are not paying, it's not ripples, it's waves,\" Aron Beezley, co-leader of the Government Contracts Practice Group at Bradley, a national law firm, told CBS News.Personnel needed to process paymentSome federal contracts are fully funded, meaning the government has already allocated money to a given job, and it's likely to continue.\"If your contract is fully funded by the previous year's appropriations, your contract will go forward, generally speaking,\" he told CBS News.But even then, companies can expect snags in getting paid on schedule during a shutdown. That's because government personnel tasked with processing contractor invoices might not be at work.\"When you submit invoices during a shutdown, the system the government uses to pay contractors requires human involvement. Invoices need to be reviewed, and a lot of times a contractor has questions for the folks who process invoices,\" Beezley explained.As a result, contractors with fully funded contracts can encounter practical impediments to receiving payments they are owed.\"If nobody is home to process the invoice, it can be challenging to get paid, which can create cash flow issues, particularly for small businesses,\" Beezley said.Partially funded contractsA company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility — that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"Attempts at legislationIn 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introducedlegislationto secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"The bill failed to advance.Small businessesAs far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"Government ShutdownMegan  CerulloMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

Which proved to be positively catnip for the money power, so she landed softly at her own joint, the Free Press.Now, though, it appears that the elite legacy media has adopted that same philosophy—or it is being dragged into it by a bunch of tech-bro gazillionaires who don’t know any more about actual journalism than she does. In this case, it’s David Ellison, son of Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the second-richest man in the world and an old pal of the current president, whom Ellison could buy and sell three times over. And if you’re willing to hire a conservative affirmative-action monitor for your newsroom, handing the wheel to an unconvincing ideological chameleon isn’t exactly a leap.Thus does the Tiffany Network turn into the Dollar Store.Watch NextAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowReaders Also ReadJustice Thomas Just Hinted at a Sinister PlanTrump Just Got Burned by a U.S. JudgePete Hegseth Doesn’t Know What “Brave” MeansTrump and Hegseth Sound Whiny and DelusionalAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowWe Have a Right-Wing Terrorism ProblemNew Lawsuit Says Trump Isn’t the “True” PresidentKash Patel Just Aided Conservative ExtremistsTrump Is Recategorizing “Terrorism” in His FavorThanks to MAHA Stupidity, Whooping Cough Is BackDemocrats Shouldn’t Compromise with Russell VoughtPete Hegseth’s Meeting Better Be Just a Photo OpThe Supreme Court Defers Lisa Cook’s RemovalAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below",

Well, it’s more like one sea, that’s actually not a sea, but an ocean. The one and only Atlantic, which will floatingly host the 2026 edition of the one and only70000 Tons of Metalcruise. A new act is set to make their live debut on the shit, and it’s sure to sound interesting.VBO, or, Vice Business Only, is a new project made up off Francesco Cavalieri, the lead vocalist of the Italian power metal band Wind Rose, and the electronic musician Simone Giusti. It’s said to be a fusion of the two genres—heavy riffing metal and synthy sonics, but the duo are intentionally keeping things hush hush, so we’ll just have to see for sure once they hit the water.The band described their addition to the 70000 Tons of Metal lineup as such:“We are VBO: Vice Business Only. Did you really think you could sail without us? What kind of party would it be without the bad boys? Forget about it… This is the plan, open your ears: we’re bringing champagne, our passion and our asses to the stage of the most metal cruise in the world: Miami – Nassau. We will be performing two world premiere concerts of our 80’s-flavored synthwave metal, and you will be the first witnesses of our rise to power, right on time to join us. And when we run out of champagne? We’re going back to refill bottles from our friends in Vice City. If you like us, come and you’ll be our guest of honor, you have our word. And for those who don’t like us, we hope they enjoy swimming to Miami. Bring yourself a nice elegant dress… It will serve you in both cases.”The cruise takes off in January 2026 from Miami, Florida to Nassau, Bahamas, floating for four days as a massive metal festival runs through two sets by each of its 60 acts.

        "text": "Save StorySave this storySave StorySave this storyIn the early aughts, thanks to my then position as editor at large of this publication, I found myself in the middle of the last great feud inGore Vidal’slong, august line of literary battles. Erudite and waspish, and routinely referred to in his lifetime as “America’s greatest man of letters,” Vidal, who would have turned 100 on October 3, 2025, had a breadth of achievement as a novelist, screenwriter, playwright, essayist, occasional politician, and TV talk show personality, one that has no equivalent—and likely never will—in American culture. He was also known for his rollicking public spats with fellow midcentury literary icons. He’d crossed swords, most famously, withWilliam F. Buckley Jr.,Norman Mailer, andTruman Capote, and had either sued, been sued by, or threatened to sue each of them. One of Vidal’s most quoted aphorisms came from a period of self-realization: “After a certain point in life, litigation replaces sex.”Each of Vidal’s feuds was the fodder for many column inches in the era’s gossip pages, contributing to the notoriety and infamy of all involved. Not to discount entirely the validity of the causes of these contretemps—Buckley, after all, had called him “you queer” and threatened to punch in his “goddamn face” on national television during one of their infamous ABC News debates at the 1968 Democratic National Convention—but the attention they brought surely was part of the point. Now, early in the 21st century, when the literary feud was long out of vogue, it was time for an ultimate heavyweight fight. This final opponent was another contributor toVanity Fair,the columnistChristopher Hitchens, who had been one of Vidal’s dearest friends.I was Vidal’s editor atVF,becoming his close friend and literary executor, and it was, in fact, Hitchens who introduced me to Vidal. We were all close enough to call one another by nicknames: Vidal unfailingly called Hitchens Hitchypoo or Poo, for short. Hitchens and I called Vidal Maestro. I was Matteo. But Hitchens, to his delight, had a second pet name bestowed by Vidal: Dauphin. And this name was to be the root cause of a disastrous, soon-to-be-very-public breakup.Christopher Hitchens poses for a portrait at The Hay Festival in Wales, May 30, 2010.David Levenson/Getty Images.On the back cover of the hard copy version of his memoir,Hitch-22,Hitchens includes, at the very bottom, a blurb from Vidal: “I have been asked whether I wish to nominate a successor, an inheritor, a dauphin or delfino. I have decided to name Christopher Hitchens.” The quotation is x-ed out in red, with “no, CH” scrawled next to it in a facsimile of Hitchens’s handwriting. A diabolically clever bit of dual-action self-promotion and goading on Hitchens’s part, it let him bask in the glow of Vidal’s approval while tweaking the nose of the great man of letters who now looked askance at him after his sudden lurch to the right in the wake of 9/11. They were both fearless, silver-tongued polemicists, part of a species of mid-to-late-20th-century celebrity that is almost extinct: the public intellectual. When they were showering each other with praise, Hitchens observed that Vidal “had the rare gift of being amusing about serious things as well as serious about amusing ones.”Both had once been ideologically aligned, at least roughly: Hitchens the caviar Trotskyite, and Vidal the FDR-style “traitor to his class” liberal. But to Vidal, Hitchens’s embrace of the Bush wars inAfghanistan and Iraqcrossed the line. “He’s gone mad, our Poo,” Vidal told his biographerJay Pariniin 2010. Even worse, Hitchens turned his fire on the Maestro himself, in the 2010Vanity Fairpiece headlined “Vidal Loco,” which claimed Vidal was buying into left-wing post-9/11 conspiracy theories. I was caught in the middle—Vidal would phone from his home in Ravello, Italy, sighing, “What has happened to the Poo?” while Hitchens, whenever we spoke, would, through me, take Vidal’s temperature on his new neocon politics. The betrayal cut deep. After all, Vidal’s career in politics and polemical writing—he was, even to his critics, the greatest essayist of his time—had always been rooted in a relentless critique of imperialism, creeping authoritarianism, the erosion of the Bill of Rights, the rise of the national security state, and the oligarchic tendencies of the political class. He could not endorse Hitchens’s embrace of the very forces he had spent a lifetime opposing, and the Dauphin title was duly stripped. There was, too, a subcutaneous aspect: Hitchens’s fame was ascendant, outstripping that of the Maestro, 24 years his senior. Vidal could never truly anoint a successor, since that would imply that Vidal might one day no longer exist. (He died at 86 in 2012; Hitchens predeceased him in 2011 at 62.) I once tried to console Hitchens by reminding him of one of Vidal’s most famous quips: “Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little.”Vidal Loco.From the VF Archive.Vidal LocoWhat has happened to Gore Vidal, the witty, tough-minded subversive of American letters, the 20th century's only possible answer to Oscar Wilde?ArrowVidal could be thin-skinned, and no one could do august like he did; someone once remarked that being in his presence was “like being in the room with an institution.” When he filled outVF’sProust Questionnaire, his answer to “What is your greatest fear?” was “Elevation to the papacy.” He liked to joke that his role in American life was akin to Queen Elizabeth II’s role in the UK: “to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn.” His essay collectionUnited States,which won the 1993 National Book Award for nonfiction, is a cinder-block-size volume that contains some of the sharpest political writing of the late 20th century. Rarely read or cited today, his essays uncannily predict the fractures, erosions, and dangers that define the current surrealist political landscape—what he called, with characteristic bluntness, “the decline of the American empire.” At the time, his portentous statements could sound exaggerated, but in retrospect they seem eerily prophetic. He could perceive like no one else (except, perhaps, forNoam Chomsky) that the seeds of the slide away from liberal democracy were already germinating.In a 1982 essay forThe Nation,“The Second American Revolution,” Vidal warned that the United States was already ceasing to function as a representative republic. Power, he argued, had passed to a “national security state”—a permanent government of corporate elites, defense contractors, and intelligence agencies whose true purpose was not to defend citizens but to preserve their own dominance. He labeled this class “the owners” and described how secrecy was used to insulate them from scrutiny. What sounded strident then now reads as prophecy: corporate power entrenched, surveillance normalized, endless war—“perpetual war for perpetual peace,” as he called it—made the norm.Gore Vidal with actor and director Noël Coward and fashion photographer and designer Cecil Beaton at an election party during the 1964 United Kingdom general election.Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images.In “The State of the Union” (Esquire,1975), Vidal pressed the point further, describing how a permanent government of thePentagon, intelligence agencies, and corporate elites had usurped real power from elected officials. Congress and the presidency, he wrote, had become stage props for an oligarchic system that operated in secret and served only itself. Again, what sounded melodramatic to some at the time now feels like plain description: the normalization of secrecy, surveillance, and politics beholden to the military industrial/tech complex. Read today, the essay is less a warning than it is a map of how the republic slipped into its current crisis, though the termdeep state,similar to what he identified, has been weaponized by the right to further demagogue the issues.Vidal returned to these themes in“The War at Home,”the firstVFessay of his I edited. He warned that the country was coming apart not just from imperial overreach of what he liked to call the Cheney-Bush oil-and-gas junta, but also from neglect at home. He saw a nation of people dispossessed, farmers forsaken, workers abandoned, pointing to those left behind by the new economy and a political class (in both parties) deaf to their grievances. “[T]here are vast areas, like rural America, that are an unmapped ultima Thule to those who own the corporations that own the media that spend billions of dollars to take polls in order to elect their lawyers to high office,” he wrote. He predicted that popular resentment would not remain latent—that it would be harnessed by demagogues who spoke in the language of populism while advancing the interests of entrenched power. At the time, critics waved it off: Vidal being Vidal. Today it reads as a forecast of the politics of grievance and resentment that would fuel the rise ofDonald Trumpand the MAGA movement.The War at HomeThe U.S. Bill of Rights is being steadily eroded, with two million telephone calls tapped, 30 million workers under electronic surveillance, and, says the author, countless Americans harassed by a government that wages spurious wars against drugs and terrorism.ArrowOne morning, soon after “The War at Home” was published, I arrived at the magazine’s offices, and my assistant,Marc Goodman,told me there was a letter on my desk that I should look at right away. Many pages, handwritten in tiny script on yellow lined paper, it was from the Oklahoma City bomber,Timothy McVeigh, with a return address of the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. There was a Post-it on the first page: “Hey Matt, please pass this on to Gore. —Tim.” It was duly faxed to Ravello. Vidal called, aglow. McVeigh had been studying the Bill of Rights while on death row and reading a lot of Gore Vidal. The two started a correspondence about their mutual interest in the erosion of the Bill of Rights, which became the basis for another essay, “The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh.” In that piece, later selected for the 2022 edition ofThe Best American Essays,Vidal set out not to excuse McVeigh’s atrocity—he was careful to note that nothing could justify the killing of 168 people, including 19 children in the day care center of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City—but to place the bomber’s fury in a wider American context. He argued that McVeigh’s rage over Waco (a federal siege ending in the deaths of 82 people) and Ruby Ridge (a raid in Idaho that left three dead), along with his distrust of an unaccountable federal government, reflected a deep alienation shared by millions, especially neglected rural and working-class Americans. The reception was explosive: Critics accused Vidal of giving a platform to a mass murderer, even as he stressed that he did not condone the bombing and insisted that McVeigh’s mindset revealed the sickness of the republic. McVeigh, who invited Vidal to witness his execution in June 2001, became a kind of dark mirror to Vidal’s analysis. Vidal made plans to attend the death by lethal injection but canceled at the last minute. “He’s a harbinger,” Vidal told me. I was not sure I completely believed him at the time, but that harbinger now looks an awful lot like one foreshadowing the arrival of Trump and the MAGA movement, which have been very effective at channeling the same grievances into political power. That brings to mind another Vidal line: “The four most beautiful words in the English language, ‘I told you so.’”The Meaning of Timothy McVeighGore Vidal’s 1998 Vanity Fair essay on the erosion of the U.S. Bill of Rights caused McVeigh to begin a three-year correspondence with Vidal, prompting an examination of certain evidence that points to darker truths-a conspiracy willfully ignored by F.B.I. investigators, and a possible cover-up by a government waging a secret war on the liberty of its citizens.ArrowEditing Vidal was an adventure on many fronts. In the lush days of Condé Nast’s bottomless expense accounts and budgets, lavish gifts were the norm when a star writer turned in a big piece. Vidal drank gin by the gallon (to wash down the Macallan 12), so once I sent a case of Bombay Sapphire to Ravello. Turns out the gin had to be driven 170 miles from Rome. The fax machine soon spat out a page with his scrawl: “Mother’s milk arrived with trucker’s compliments.” There were other contributor perks. He could only write his essays on vintage portable Olivetti Lettera typewriters (novels were composed in long hand on legal pads). The Olivettis were getting harder to repair, so my assistant found a trove of them and ordered the lot. We kept about a half dozen in the office to FedEx to Italy for stuck keys and other technological emergencies. Once, when Vidal was on deadline and staying in his usual suite at The Plaza in Manhattan, an Olivetti was messengered over for him. He and I got back from a long, wet dinner at the restaurant Daniel, and he sat down to write while I was still there. I was amazed to see that he composed those long, intricate essays using one finger, pecking out a single letter at a time. A typist was hired to create a final draft from the messy, marked-up Olivetti typescripts, and he never dropped a stitch in his copy. He was probably the only writer in the history of the magazine allowed by the revered copy chief,Peter Devine,to invent a word. It was the adverbsickenly,a short version ofsickeningly,that Devine let slide, saying, “After all, it’s Gore Vidal.”As Vidal and I grew closer, I made trips to Ravello to visit him and his companion of more than 40 years,Howard Austen. They lived at La Rondinaia, a vast four-level villa built into the side of a sheer cliff and surrounded by terraced gardens, overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea. The world came to Vidal in Ravello. In the guest rooms there were silver-framed photos of famous previous occupants:Johnny and Joanna Carson,Lauren Bacall,Paul NewmanandJoanne Woodward,Leonard Bernstein,Rudolf Nureyev. WhenHillary Clintonpaid a visit in 1994,La Repubblica’s headline was “Lady Clinton nel Paradiso di Vidal.” It was there that the Maestro could read and write with the distractions of the modern world kept at a safe distance, while Austen dealt with all quotidian matters. An admirer of his paternal grandfather, the populist Oklahoma senator T.P. Gore, a man of the 19th and early 20th century, Vidal identified more with those pretech times. I think it helped him conjure the distant pasts of his historical novels, which were meticulously researched and scrawled out on yellow legal pads. (His book1876landed him on the cover ofTimemagazine in 1976, butBurrandLincolnare his two masterpieces of the genre.) His only nod to the digital age was his fax machine, which made sending manuscripts a breeze. He called his hi-fi “the victrola” and hadn’t driven a car in decades. He walked the stairs and terraces of the Amalfi Coast daily, which I think contributed to his relative longevity, despite levels of alcohol consumption that were hard to reconcile with such a staggeringly prolific career. He prided himself on never drinking on the job. While staying with him, I noted that he worked regular hours, reading and writing in his book-lined studio overlooking the sea from 10 a.m. until lunch. He then went back to work until, as he said, “the shadows grow long”—cocktail hour—about 5 p.m. He pronounced to me once that his doctor told him he had “a perfect liver.” And true, it never gave out. When his feuding rival of the ’60s and ’70s, Truman Capote—who Vidal frequently claimed did drink while working—died at the home of Joanne Carson, one of his “swans,” in 1984, Vidal’s infamous response was, “Good career move.” Their fractious relationship blossomed into a lawsuit in 1975. Thereafter, Vidal dismissed Capote with the line, “I saw him only once again, in 1968, when, without my glasses, I mistook him for a small ottoman, and sat down on him.”Vidal campaigning as the Democratic candidate for Congress for the 29th Congressional District of New York in Poughkeepsie, April 7, 1960.Ben Martin/Getty Images.In his 1995 memoir,Palimpsest—a sociopolitical atlas of the second half of the 20th century and a majestic, score-settling epic—Vidal rehashed the other great feuds that punctuated his career, long before Hitchypoo landed on these shores. Among them was his long-running battle withNorman Mailer, which flared across decades in print, on television, and even in physical altercations. Mailer once headbutted Vidal in a greenroom atThe Dick Cavett Show,only to be met with Vidal’s rejoinder: “As usual, words fail Norman Mailer.” During the show, a drunken Mailer hurled insults, while Vidal, with Cavett on his side, fended him off with icy calm and won over the studio audience. They officially made peace in a 1991Esquirefeature, which began: “For nearly twenty years, they jabbed and slugged and said mean things. Mailer: ‘Liar…hypocrite…you pollute the intellectual rivers…’ Vidal: ‘Henry Miller…Norman Mailer…Charles Manson…a logical progression.’ This winter, at the Plaza Hotel, on a blustering afternoon, their epic feud ends in a clinch—not to say an embrace.” One is wistful for a time when magazines breathlessly covered the contretemps of titans such as these, rather than the latest Kardashian to join the ranks of billionaires.There were affectionate sketches in the memoir as well: While touring Europe with Tennessee Williams, whom Vidal called “the Bird,” in 1948, Vidal was excited to land a dinner withNoël Coward. “We were served kidneys,” Vidal wrote, “which neither of us ate. Coward, whom we had just met, then proceeded to enact for us the entire story of his professional life, often springing up from the table to assault the piano as he brayed briskly the lyrics of past triumphs to my delight and Tennessee’s disgust. ‘He thinks,’ said the Bird as we vanished into the night, ‘that we don’t know who he is.’”Orson Wellesdrifted through the pages as a frequent lunch companion at LA’s 1970s hot spot Ma Maison, always desperate for money, and forever pitching implausible schemes to keep creditors at bay. Vidal recalled Paul Bowles, the expatriate writer-composer in Tangier, and Anaïs Nin, whose self-mythologizing amused him and inspired a satirical portrait in his novelTwo Sisters.One of my favorite Vidal stories, aboutEleanor Roosevelt, was always told with a brilliant impersonation of her high mid-Atlantic intonations. He had gone to visit the former first lady at her home, Val-Kill Cottage, near Hyde Park, New York. He knocked on the door; no one answered, but the door was ajar, so he walked in, and saw, in a powder room off the entry hall, her unmistakable tall silhouette standing over the toilet. He startled her, and she said, “Oh dear, now you know my secret.” He thought, Oh God, no… But then she backed away to reveal a spray of gladiolus arranged in the toilet bowl. “It does keep them fresh,” she said.In the end, of all Vidal’s battles, the Buckley feud was the defining one—a lifelong preoccupation. Once, in Ravello, Vidal and I watched all 10 of the 1968 convention debates, which he had preserved on VHS. He couldn’t stop reliving it. As Buckley’s biographerSam Tanenhausobserves inBuckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America:“The curious alchemy of the close-in camera and the microphone made Buckley and Vidal seem born for TV combat, mirror images of superior intellect, cutting wit, and comical disdain. Their mellifluous old-style transatlantic stage voices even sounded alike.” ABC, perpetually in last place, had hired them to add spice to its 1968 convention coverage. What it got instead was a template for the gladiatorial punditry that would come to define political television for decades.On August 28, 1968, the day after the police riots on Michigan Avenue, the exchanges boiled over. What began as political commentary collapsed into bizarre, personal invective, with the encounter remaining one of the most famous moments in broadcast history. “Viewers across the country,” Tanenhaus writes, “…who had seen hours of what looked like anarchy in the streets of the country’s greatest heartland city—watched as Buckley, his face contorted with rage, and seemingly about to lunge up from his chair, spat out what would be for many the words remembered best in a life devoted to language, spoken and written…”BUCKLEY: Now, listen, you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi, or I’ll sock you in your goddam face and you’ll stay plastered.VIDAL: Oh, Bill.BUCKLEY: Let Myra Breckinridge go back to his pornography and stop making any allusions of Nazism.HOWARD K. SMITH, moderator: I beg you to…“Queer,” Tanenhaus reports, “was the epithet Buckley had been using for years, almost any time Vidal’s name came up.” But here, he went further, feminizing Vidal by equating him with the transgender heroine of his then runaway bestseller. Turnabout is fair play, though; Vidal used to taunt Buckley by saying, “I based Myra Breckinridge on you.” And he called him “the Marie Antoinette of American politics.” Buckley’s wife, Pat, reportedly told the journalist Murray Kempton that “200 million Americans think William F. Buckley is a screaming homosexual.”Gore Vidal, 1959.Bettmann/Getty Images.Tanenhaus quotes a friend of both men as saying, “Gore thought Bill was getting away with something.” Tanenhaus adds: “Getting away, that is, with concealing his own homosexuality and securing his respectable place in polite society by exposing the ‘subversions’ or ‘perversions’ of others.” Buckley’s attack came at Vidal’s greatest vulnerability, his refusal to remain silent about sexuality at a time when nearly everyone else did. In 1948 he had risked his career by publishingThe City and the Pillar,often thought of as the first American novel with an unapologetically homosexual protagonist. The book got him blacklisted by much of the establishment press. He liked to say he spent the rest of his career fighting what he called “the heterosexual dictatorship”—the cultural order that forbade honest acknowledgment of homosexuality in public life. This made up a good deal of his beef with Buckley, who he thought was a hypocrite on this front, since Buckley’s magazine, theNational Review,was, according to Tanenhaus’s biography, in the practice of, at times, exposing closeted gay men through “blind items.”Watching the debates years later in Ravello, Vidal seemed half-delighted, half-wounded. Buckley had used homophobia to smear him in front of a national audience. I could see it still stung. Neither man would ever escape the shadow of that night. What followed was a rancorous postscript: duelingEsquirearticles that rehashed the feud, and a lawsuit. In his cups, Vidal would roar his own counternarrative: “I was the butchest boy at Exeter. He’s the screeching queen!”I think that Hitchens’s favorite Vidalism was, “Never pass up an opportunity to have sex or appear on television.” Vidal lived long enough to see both activities—once his twin arenas of sport and fame—become more fraught, whether in the shadow ofHIV/AIDSor the more lasting plague of premium cable. How he would have fared in the age of social media is a moot point. He just missed it, and surely this atomized world of self-promotion and fragmented attention could not have been for him. On network television, in the age of 50 million viewers all bathed in the same cathode light, he reigned: a regular on Johnny Carson’sTonight ShowandCavett,rarely slumming beneathThe Merv Griffin Show.He was born at precisely the right time to exploit his unique talents—equal parts polemicist, satirist, blockbuster novelist, and grand provocateur. Timing, as Vidal’s great friendNorman Learused to say, is everything.",

        "text": "AI·Tech Bubble‘We are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them’: The CEO whose 80% stock plunge personified the dotcom bubble on AI’s impactByMichael LiedtkeByThe Associated PressByMichael LiedtkeByThe Associated PressFormer Cisco CEO John Chambers.Chesnot/Getty ImagesFormerCisco SystemsCEO John Chambers learned all about technology’s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet’s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world’s most valuable company — worth $550 billion in March 2000 — before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco’s stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley’s most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company’s stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.While remaining Cisco’s chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI’s transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren’t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.Q: Does that worry you?A: Big time!Q: What do we need to be doing to be prepared for this upheaval?A: We need to change education. Entry-level jobs, both white and blue collar, are going to disappear fast. We are creating more productivity, but we have to create more jobs as well. If companies start making more money, they are either going to increase the dividend or invest in new areas. Hopefully, the majority will invest in new areas to create new jobs.You will see successful companies expand and grow dramatically, but you are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear. They won’t have the skills to adjust to this new innovation economy driven by AI because they were trained in silos they were trained to move at the speed of a five-year cycle as opposed to a 12-month cycle.Q: Do you think this is one of the most uncertain times you have ever seen?A: It’s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don’t know how to do, especially with AI.Q: What’s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?A: Let’s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn’t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren’t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.Q: How worried are you about China?A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.’s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don’t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it’s in the U.S.’s best interest and it’s in China’s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that’s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.Fortune Global Forumreturns Oct. 26–27, 2025 in Riyadh.

The developer had confirmed its removal on Thursday evening.“We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock has been removed from the App Store due to “objectionable content’,” ICEBlock said in a social media post. “The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin. We have responded and we’ll fight this!”The developer said last month that it had more than 1 million users.

This week, a boycott campaign took off on X, spearheaded byfar-right transphobeChaya “Libs of TikTok” Raichik, over the presence of children’s series and movies that feature suchhorrificscenes as a boy wearing a dress (gasp!), a transgender charactertalking to reporters(egad!), and a kid telling a robot about the termnonbinary(gadzooks!!). This has escalated to accusations of Netflix “grooming children,” which have been boosted byX owner Elon Muskand byelected Republican lawmakers. (One of them is now threatening todrag Netflix executives in front of Congress, while Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has referred to a cartoon series as “abuse” and promoted her law to ban gender-affirming care.) As of Friday, various X accounts are continuing to air out what they find so objectionable on Netflix, from its production deal with the Obamas to its employees, while promoting alternative streaming services and programming to their rage-baited followers. The corporation itself has not commented on the matter.Netflix boycott threats are a common tactic on the right, as ironically evidenced by Raichik herself, who’s been sharing screenshots ofold Charlie Kirk tweetscalling the company “a pedophile streaming platform.” (One user who claimed to be canceling their subscription was revealed to have said they’d previously canceled their Netflix accountlast year, and the year before that.) The online anti-trans fury does feel a touch more powerful this round, with sympathetic leaders in government who will gladly join something as stupid as thebrigade against Cracker Barrel’s logo change. But, considering Netflix’s own right-wing bona fides, will this actually lead to an ideological protest on par with the Disney+/Hulu cancellations that spurred thereinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel’s show? Here’s an explainer for how this campaign against Netflix kicked off, what it really means for the streaming business, and why this may not have the oft-noted “Bud Light” impact.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMan, how did we get here?This all began Monday, when Raichik shared aclipfrom the Netflix Original animated seriesDead End: Paranormal Park, which ran for only two seasons and was canceled in 2023—but which, Raichikincorrectly posited, was being actively “promoted” on Netflix Kids. The 40-second segment involves a character finding affirmation in their trans identity, in a monologue that ends with another character making an unrelated joke. Raichik, whose posts havelong inspired vigilante threatsagainst schools and hospitals with trans-inclusive policies, thentargetedshow creator Hamish Steele, an award-winning trans cartoonist in London who’d referred to Charlie Kirk as a “random nazi” in a post-assassination tweet. (Steele, who has locked their X account, posted about receiving “extremely nasty weird homophobic and antisemitic emails” in the aftermath and is now taking a social media break.)Elon Musk hopped on to say that the perfectly anodyneDead Endclip was “not ok,” and Raichikclaimed soon afterthat the Tesla CEO had ended his Netflix subscription. By Tuesday, Libs of TikTok had posted a screenshot of her cancel-confirmation email and encouraged others to do the same. The voice actor behind theDead Endcharacter responded directly to Raichik, speaking to his own trans identity andwriting on X, “you can fear monger all you want, but kids & parents have told me [the show] saved their lives!!”AdvertisementAdvertisement… That was it? A clip from an already-ended show that wasn’t even being promoted got Libs of TikTok all hopping mad?Well, after the Musk boost, she felt empowered to attack other movies and shows, however flimsily. On Wednesday, shehighlightedTransformer: Earthspark, an animated kids’ sitcom that wascommissioned for Paramount+in 2022. AStrawberry ShortcakeTV movie from 2023 (which was also not a Netflix Original) earned her anger for featuring amale character who wears a dress. Another long-canceled Netflix show, the 2020–21Baby-Sitters Clubrevival, came to her attention for a scene where a girlcorrects hospital staffon her bedridden friend’s gender identity. And then Raichik went after another Paramount+ original, 2022’sMonster High: The Movie, which is reportedly streaming on Netflix U.K. and had committed the sin of having two charactersintroduce each other with their preferred pronouns.AdvertisementAdvertisementReally, these are harmless and brief segments weaponized on behalf of a conservative movement that’s been seeking toerasetransgender identity altogether, frompseudoscientific effortsto outlaw gender-affirming care for minors toscrubbing trans Americansfrom historical monuments. To these cruel people, the very depiction of a transgender person is tantamount to indoctrination, as is the (to them) inconvenient reality that young peopledo experience gender dysphoriaand can understand the concept of gender fluidity. If you’ve imbibed enough far-right propaganda to become a J.K. Rowling type who believes that top surgery is “mutilation,” then anything about trans people will make you feel upset.AdvertisementAdvertisementI seem to recall that Elon Musk isestranged from his trans daughter.Indeed, and that’s spurred his mission to defeat the “woke mind virus.” He’s made nice with quite a few other transphobes lately, including Graham Linehan, theFather TedandIT Crowdcreator who wasbriefly arrested in London last monthfor tweets that invited readers to “punch” trans women “in the balls” if they’re situated in women-oriented spaces. (Linehan later wrote on Substack that this was “a serious point made with a joke” and “not a call to violence.”) Linehan, who has alengthy recordof transphobic rhetoric,announced his own Netflix cancellationon X in a Wednesday tweet that was celebrated by Musk. Morepaid-blue-check accountswho lied that Netflix is losing “millions” of customers joined in the fun throughout Wednesday, whileGod’s Not DeadactorKevin Sorboand hiswifeposted videos praising Raichik and Musk, with the former using the opportunity to also promote the “Christian publishing company” Brave Books—which happens to have apaid streaming service for kids.Ah yes, it’s grifting time.Better believe it! The Christian production company Angel Studios (best knownforSound of Freedom) soon begantrendingon X, as paid-check accounts recommended its streaming platform as a Netflix alternative. More enterprising users dug in and found that the Texan venture capital firm Gigafund, known for employing many Musk lackeys who’ve invested in his enterprises (SpaceX, the Boring Company, Neuralink), had helmed amultimillion-dollar fundraising roundfor Angel Studios back in 2022. Some of the more Christian nationalist types on X haveobjectedto Angel’s history with Mormon founders, however. (Notably, no one seems to be recommendingTruth Social’s homegrown streaming service. Sad!)Eeesh, what a weird social network.Right? You could see more evidence of this throughout the week, as other activists dug into every Netflix corner they could to “expose” the company as an indoctrination factory. One tweeted out atrans-character-centered articlefrom Netflix’s in-house publication, Tudum, posted earlier this year in honor of International Trans Day of Visibility. This user also shared aMay 2024 Netflix press releasethat touted its Fund for Creative Equity’s support of the Transgender Film Center’s Career Development Lab. Raichik, meanwhile, extended her purview to target other Netflix titles like thepopular 2023 movieLeave the World Behind, an Obama-produced feature that she accused of “hating white people” despite including many prominent white people in its cast. From there, individual Netflix investors who’d worked in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives were singled out as part and parcel of a “child grooming epidemic.” Anti-DEI crusader andMeta employeeRobby Starbuck was mortified by the fact that various Netflix executives attended acorporate workshop in 2019that centered on privilege and allyship.AdvertisementAdvertisementI don’t get it, though. Hasn’t Netflix taken a right-wing tack recently?Correct! CEO Ted Sarandos hasdined at Mar-a-Lagowith Donald Trump. Netflix signed a deal withreactionary comic Tony Hinchcliffenot long after theKill Tonyfounder made thatracist joke about Puerto Ricansat Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. The streamer alsopartnered last yearwith Shane Gillis, the stand-up comedian who wasinfamously firedfromSaturday Night Livein 2019 after his racist anti-Asian podcast segments were unearthed. (Gillis continues tohang out with outright racistson his podcasts, and Netflix has producedother stand-up specials with open anti-Asian racism.)Chairman Reed Hastings may haveinadvertently fueled another conservative cancellation cyclelast year when he donated to Kamala Harris’ campaign, but he’s consistently defended Dave Chappelle’s transphobia, and his company has frequentlybacked “anti-woke” entertainmentlike the reality showSnowflake Mountainand a whole host ofstand-up specials whose titles riff on the onetime buzzwordtriggered. In 2022, after Elon Musk accused Netflix of harboring the “woke mind virus,” company leadershipdropped certain dealswith Black producers like Ava DuVernay and Ibram X. Kendi.These guys get mad about Netflix pretty often, don’t they?They do, which is why I’m not convinced that this round will leave any lasting damage on the service. The right-wing outrage overthe 2020 filmCutiesrevved up many of the same talking points we see now, and multiple surveys demonstrate that Netflix’s customer base remainsoverwhelminglyliberal. (Notably, Tesla stock also took a little dive on Friday, perhaps because Musk’s crusade is reawakeningshareholder fears that he’s engaging in politicsagain.)All of which is to say: Conservatives only have so many accounts they can cancel, and the Streisand effect may just spur liberal viewers to check out the shows and movies that the far-right is binge-watching forcontent.Get the best of news and politicsSign up for Slate's evening newsletter.Thanks for signing up!

He was 84.His death was announced today by a family spokesperson, who noted that Mitchum’s wife Pamela was at his side along with the couple’s beloved poodle.Related StoriesObituaries2025 Deaths Photo Gallery: Hollywood & Media ObituariesNewsRemembering Robert Redford: A Career In PhotosBorn in Los Angeles May 8, 1941, to theNight of the Hunteractor and Dorothy Spence Mitchum, Jim Mitchum made his film debut at age 8 in the Raoul Walsh Western Colorado Territory. Despite his mother’s wish to keep the boy out of the Hollywood spotlight, his resemblance at 16 to his father was such that he was cast as Robert’s younger brother inThunder Road. Robert Mitchum produced the film about Southern whiskey runners pitted against federal agents and organized crime.InThunder Road, Jim Mitchum (who also was sometimes credited under the nameJames Mitchum) played an auto mechanic, leading to a real-life interest in stock car racing and working for a while on Elvis Presley’s hot rods. The younger Mitchum became friends with Presley and briefly attempted a singing career, recording the 1961 single “Lonely Birthday,” which was not a hit.While his singing career failed, Mitchum would turn more seriously to acting, appearing in 11 films and television series throughout the 1960s, most notablyThe Victors(1963), a WWII drama starring George Peppard, Albert Finney and Mitchum’s friend George Hamilton;Ride the Wild Surf(1964), co-starring Fabian and Shelley Fabares;In Harm’s Way(1965) with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas; andAmbush Bay(1966) with Hugh O’Brien and Mickey Rooney.In 1971, Mitchum had a cameo in Monte Hellman’s drive-in classicTwo-Lane Blacktopstarring James Taylor and Dennis Wilson, and that Mitchum was among the friends of Dennis Hopper (including Peter Fonda and Kris Kristoffrson) invited to Peru to filmThe Last Movie, a notorious flop. During the shoot, Mitchum filmed a short making-of documentary calledThe Last Movie Movie.Among his notable subsequent credits wasMoonrunners(1975), which inspired the TV seriesThe Dukes of Hazard.Mitchum retired from acting in 1994 (three years before his father’s death). In his later life he was a breeder of Quarter Horses at his ranch in Skull Valley and developed a line of premium moonshine, traditional corn whiskey and Robert’s Rye whiskey, in homage to his father’s films,Thunder RoadandOut of the Past.Mitchum’s marriage in 1968 to actress Wende Wagner ended in divorce 10 years later. He married Vivian Ferrand in 1985 and divorced in 1995. He had met Arizona English professor  Pamela K. Smith in 1993 and began a friendship that developed into a romance. They married in 2025.In addition to his wife, Mitchum is survived by brother Christoper Mitchum, sister Petrine Day Mitchum, daughter Ana Liljeback, son Will Spence Mitchum, stepdaughter Tiffany Mitchum Greene, son Brian Price Mitchum, daughter Caitlin Ann Mitchum, and a large extended family including in-laws, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren.‘Taylor Swift: Showgirl’ Dances To $30M-$32M As ‘Smashing Machine’ Submits‘Official Release Party Of A Showgirl’ Is A Study Of Taylor Swift’s Work Ethic: ReviewFox Sports Analyst & Ex-NFL QB Mark Sanchez “Stable” After StabbingPrime Video Renews ‘Bosch’ Spinoff ‘Ballard’ For Season 2: The DishRead More About:CommentsSubscribe to DeadlineGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.Sign UpNo CommentsCancel replySubmit a commentComments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Watch live shows and highlights 24/7]With wins in the wild-card round, the Tigers, Yankees, Dodgers and Cubs are on to the next round. (Davis Long/Yahoo Sports)No. 6 Detroit Tigers vs. No. 2 Seattle MarinersHow they got hereTigers:After amassing baseball’s best record through 93 games and building an enormous lead atop the AL Central, Detroit gradually tumbled down the standings in dramatic fashion down the stretch, ceding the division title to the Guardians and barely qualifying for the postseason. Then the Tigers immediately redeemed themselves in the wild-card round, marching into Cleveland andtaking two of three to eliminate their rivals and keep their season alive. Now they have the opportunity to further distance themselves from their miserable second half in the ALDS.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMariners:Fueled by a historic campaign from catcher Cal Raleigh and a balanced roster that was bolstered even further at the trade deadline, the Marinerswon their first division title since 2001, dethroning an Astros team that had been the gold standard in the AL West for the past decade. The Mariners’ scorching-hot September combined with Detroit’s drastic decline to secure a first-round bye for Seattle and home-field advantage in the ALDS. Now the Mariners welcome that Tigers team to town for the first postseason meeting between the two franchises.X-factorTigers:Javier BáezA stunning resurgence in the first half as Detroit’s fill-in center fielder earned Báez an invite to the All-Star Game, but his notoriously aggressive approach was eventually exploited by pitchers, causing some harsh second-half regression that significantly sapped his overall statline. Still, Báez — who has since reclaimed the starting shortstop job from Trey Sweeney — is one of the few Tigers with significant postseason experience, and that showed in Detroit’s wild-card win over Cleveland, as Báez shined with a team-leading five hits and some marvelous glovework in the infield. While his offensive output is sure to fluctuate at the whim of his reckless plate discipline, Báez has the talent and big-game bona fides to make an impact on this series on both sides of the ball.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMariners:Bryan WooNo need to overcomplicate this one: The availability of Seattle’s best pitcheris uncertainafter the breakout right-hander left his start Sept. 19 in Houston due to a pec injury and didn’t pitch again in the regular season.That’s obviously a huge deal. Woo was never placed on the injured list and threw a 25-pitch bullpen Thursday, but the Mariners reportedly want him to throw another bullpen before he returns to game action, suggesting that it’s unlikely he’s an option for the first two games of this series. That’s not the end of the world for Seattle, considering the other quality arms at its disposal (Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, Luis Castillo), but if Woo remains unavailable as the series shifts to Detroit, it could put the Mariners in a precarious position, especially if the Tigers steal a game in Seattle.UPDATE:Woowas not on the Mariners' ALDS rosterreleased Saturday morning, so Seattle will be without its ace for the entire series.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementHow they winTigers:Speaking of the Tigers’ chances of snagging a road victory, they’ll have the privilege of giving the ball to Tarik Skubal in ALDS Game 2, fresh offa brilliant showing in Game 1 of the wild-card round. The Mariners were the only team in baseball to defeat Skubal twice this season, but he appears to have found another gear this month, which could provide the Tigers the edge to neutralize Seattle’s home-field advantage.Beyond Skubal, it’ll be on manager A.J. Hinch to identify the right combination of pitchers to neutralize Seattle’s slugging-centric lineup, which features a healthy amount of swing-and-miss that could be exploited. That said, even if Detroit’s pitching staff is up to the task, the Tigers need to find more consistency hitting with runners in scoring position, which has been a notable struggle over the past month, including in the wild-card round. If that improves and Detroit can carry the momentum recaptured against Cleveland — and if the Mariners can’t shake off the rust from the time off — the Tigers can pull off the upset.Mariners:In adding Eugenio Suárez and Josh Naylor at the trade deadline, the Mariners put the finishing touches on the most dangerous lineup the franchise has assembled in decades. Suárez and Naylor bring their own flavor of offensive contributions to a lineup that already featuredan unprecedented performer in Raleigh, a second-half superstar in Julio Rodríguez and an October legend in Randy Arozarena, among other very good bats. This strength gives Seattle a clear edge in this series and should help compensate for a potential Woo absence on the mound. And even without Woo, Seattle’s pitching staff looks better than Detroit’s on paper once you get past Skubal. If the Mariners can embrace their status as favorites and not wilt under the pressure of unfamiliar expectations, they should emerge victorious.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementSeries prediction: Mariners in 4Detroit should not be taken lightly, and it’ll be interesting to see how the Tigers benefit from having a manager in Hinch who has infinitely more experience navigating postseason games than Seattle skipper Dan Wilson. However, Seattle’s superior roster and how the team has been firing on all cylinders over the past month are enough evidence to lean toward the Mariners in this matchup. —ShustermanNo. 4 New York Yankees vs. No. 1 Toronto Blue JaysHow they got hereYankees:In the regular season, the Yankees started hot (35-22 through May) and finished hot (18-7 in September), with an ugly stretch in June and July ultimately costing New York the AL East crown. As a result of losing the tiebreaker to the Blue Jays, the Yankees had to navigate the wild-card round against the rival Red Sox, which they did in rare fashion: They were the first team since the reintroduction of the best-of-three wild-card round in 2022 to advance after losing Game 1. After beingdownright dominated by Garrett Crochet in Game 1, the Yankees responded admirably,with consecutive victories to defend their home turfand advance to the division series, where, remarkably, they will face the Blue Jays in the postseason for the first time.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBlue Jays:With holding a 26-28 record that had them eight games behind the Yankees on May 27, the Blue Jays surged over the course of the summer andfended off a late charge by New York to secure their first AL East title since 2015. While the Blue Jays finished with an identical record to the Yankees, going 8-5 in the season series against New York ensured the tiebreaker and, in turn, the top seed in the American League, a welcome advantage for a club that posted the second-best home record in baseball (54-27), behind only the Phillies.X-factorYankees:Cam SchlittlerWith a spectacular outing in Game 3 of the wild-card roundagainst Boston, Schlittler amplified his national profile tenfold and became a main character for the Yankees. Assuming this series doesn’t end in a sweep, the rookie right-hander will be lined up to start a pivotal Game 4 in the Bronx. And unlike the Red Sox, who were facing Schlittler for the first time this season Thursday, the Blue Jays would be seeing him for the third time, adding intrigue to a potential showdown on the postseason stage.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementSchlittler’s second career start came in Toronto on July 22, when he allowed two runs over five unremarkable innings. Then the Jays knocked Schlittler out in the second inning Sept. 5 at Yankee Stadium, though Schlittler later suggested he wastipping his pitchesin that affair. Either way, that familiarity — and Toronto’s lineup depth relative to Boston’s — could make Schlittler’s next assignment more challenging. But if he can come anywhere close to replicating his stupendous wild-card form, he could play a massive role in this series, either in saving the Yankees if they’re on the brink or in helping propel them to the ALCS.Blue Jays:Trey YesavageSticking with the theme of rookie right-handers, Yesavage’s meteoric rise in 2025 makes Schlittler look like a grizzled veteran. Toronto’s first-round draft pick just 15 months ago, Yesavage began this season in A-ball and rocketed through the minors in time to make his major-league debut in September.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementInjuries to José Berríos and Chris Bassitt, plus some serious recent struggles from Max Scherzer (10.20 ERA across 15 innings in four September starts), have Toronto’s rotation in flux beyond Kevin Gausman and Shane Bieber. Manager John Schneiderhas been coy aboutthe way he plans to deploy the rookie in this series, but based on the current depth chart, it seems Yesavage is going to be relied on to play a crucial role in Toronto’s run-prevention plans against New York. His talent is undeniable, but how Yesavage handles the pressure after such little big-league time will be fascinating to see.How they winYankees:The Yankees have a compelling case as the most talented roster on the AL side of the bracket, and that started to shine through against Boston. The Blue Jays entered October with the highest ERA of any postseason team, while the Yankees boasted baseball’s best offense by multiple measures,helped, of course, by a historically dominant presence in Aaron Judge.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThat combination alone suggests that New York could simply outmuscle Toronto offensively, plus Schlittler’s emergence gives the Yankees a third starting pitcher to feel great about, alongside All-Star left-handers Max Fried and Carlos Rodón. If New York’s volatile bullpen unit can avoid major meltdowns and Judge can find his power stroke (his four hits in the wild-card round were all singles), the Yankees should be in good shape.Blue Jays:The Yankees feature more standout performers on paper, but it wasn’t an accident that the Blue Jays won the season series and 94 games. Even with an inconsistent pitching staff and Bo Bichette’sexpected absence due to a knee injury, this is a roster with significant upside and the star power to combat the high-profile opponent. That’s most apparent in the lineup, where Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and George Springer lead a balanced group that doesn’t slug quite like the Yankees but is significantly better at putting the ball in play.That core competency of making contact could come in handy against a Yankees defense known for its fair share of flubs in high-pressure moments, a weakness that exists in stark contrast to Toronto’s stellar glovework. If Toronto can handle its business in Game 1, given what should be a sizable advantage with Gausman on the mound, the Blue Jays should be able to capitalize on home-field advantage and move on to the ALCS.Series prediction: Yankees in 5Toronto has clearly assembled a formidable club but it will need to shake its recent history of October letdowns to make the most of this year’s opportunity: The Blue Jays have lost seven consecutive postseason games dating to the 2016 ALCS. In contrast, the Yankees have won 31 postseason games since the Blue Jays’ most recent October triumph. Experience and past success in these moments matter, but ultimately, it’s less about the history and more about how these rosters stack up. Right now, that tilts in New York’s favor, ever so slightly. —ShustermanNo. 3 L.A. Dodgers vs. No. 2 Philadelphia PhilliesHow they got hereDodgers:The Dodgersmade quick work of the Cincinnati Reds in the wild-card roundas the only team to sweep in the first round. What stood out about L.A.’s first-round performance was just how dominant the Dodgers looked offensively. In two games, they scored 18 runs on 28 hits. And not only did L.A. get two-homer games from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, but they also enjoyed impressive performances from Mookie Betts, Kiké Hernández and Tommy Edman, notable Dodgers stars of Octobers past.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementPhillies:The Phillies roll into the NLDS as winners of the NL East who have been waiting for their next opponent. Philly got better as the regular season went along, and after overtaking the Mets in August, the Phillies clearly hit their stride. This year, it feels like they are the favorites in the National League, even with the reigning champions lining up across the field. One of the biggest benefits for the Phillies is that their bye week has allowed shortstop Trea Turner to get healthy after missing most of September due to a hamstring injury.X-factorDodgers:Mookie BettsAfter a down year for the former MVP, Betts started to put things together in September, looking more like the player we’ve watched for the past decade. That recent hot stretch carried into the postseason at the perfect time for the Dodgers, as Bettswent an impressive 6-for-9 in the wild-card roundand stood out as a major part of L.A.’s victory. The shortstop thrives on confidence, and when he’s at his best, there are few players better on the field. If this version of Betts is here to stay, the Dodgers’ offense is about to take off in a major way.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementPhillies:Bryce HarperIf there’s one thing you can always count on in the MLB postseason, it’s a big moment from Bryce Harper. Especially since he signed with the Phillies, Harper has been no stranger to making an impact in the postseason, and while much of the attention this season has been on Kyle Schwarber’s MVP-caliber season, let’s not forget about the man known as “MV3.” The first baseman comes into this postseason with a career 1.016 OPS with 17 homers in October. Harper is one of the best postseason performers in recent baseball history, so expect him to make noise in this series.And then there were eight. The division series begins Saturday. (Taylor Wilhelm/Yahoo Sports)How they winDodgers:The Dodgers showed in the wild-card round just how good they can be when firing on all cylinders offensively. And it wasn’t just from the likes of Ohtani and Betts — they got plenty of other production from throughout the lineup. Not to mention, Yoshinobu Yamamoto showed in Game 2 why he is one of the best pitchers in baseball. If L.A.’s lineup and starting pitchers can deliver at the same level they showed against Cincinnati, they’ll go a long way this postseason and could be an even better version of the team that lifted the World Series trophy last year.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementPhillies:The Phillies have plenty of offensive firepower of their own, but this series against the Dodgers will come down to their starting pitching, where Philly has the advantage.If the Philadelphia trio of Cristopher Sánchez, Ranger Suarez and Jes­s Luzardo pitch at their best, the Phillies have a great opportunity to reach the NLCS, especially with a juggernaut offense that can back them up.Series prediction: Phillies in 5This could very well be the best series of the entire postseason, featuring two heavyweights who were among the best teams in baseball this season. Like in any heavyweight bout, each side will take some big swings in this series, with plenty of star power carrying both sides. In the end, this series will likely be won in the bullpen, andL.A.’s relievers have not exactly been lock-down of late. In fact, in the series against the Reds, the bullpen was the one area where L.A. looked vulnerable. The Phillies, with shut-down closer Jhoan Duran, don’t have that issue. When the game is on the line, Philadelphia has the arms to close it out. —DorseyNo. 4 Chicago Cubs vs. No. 1 Milwaukee BrewersHow they got hereCubs:The Cubsplayed their way into the NLDS with a strong series against the Padresin which they showed their ability to not only pitch at a high level but also use their elite defense to win. After struggling the last two months of the season, Chicago’s offense also came to life late in the series, with Kyle Tucker, Seiya Suzuki and Pete Crow-Armstrong each registering key hits. Their return to being a confident trio looms large in this series against Milwaukee.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBrewers:The Brewers come into the NLDS after the best regular season in franchise history. The Brew Crew won a franchise-record 97 games, the highest win total in MLB this season, which earned Milwaukee the No. 1 overall seed in the postseason. The Brewers have done it their own way all season, and with a collection of players who might not fit well in other places, they’ve gotten plenty of production from throughout their 26-man and 40-man roster all year.X-factorCubs:The bullpenThe Cubs showed in their wild-card series against the Padres that while they might not have the flame-throwers of some other teams, they have a capable combination of out-getters. When the Cubs are tied or have a lead, it’s some combination of Daniel Palencia, Caleb Thielbar, Drew Pomeranz, Brad Keller and Andrew Kittredge, and that group has been nails for manager Craig Counsell so far this postseason. Against San Diego, that combo of Cubs relievers threw 10 2/3 innings while allowing just two runs, helping lead Chicago to the next round. If Counsell gives the ball to those arms late in games vs. Milwaukee and they pitch like they did against the Padres, good things lie ahead for Chicago.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBrewers:Christian YelichIn a magical year for the Brewers, team leader Christian Yelich has been at the center of it all. And as Yelich goes, so does Milwaukee. Although he’s not the same player he was when he won NL MVP in 2018, he is healthier than he has been in quite some time, and the numbers reflect that. The Brewers’ DH finished the regular season with 29 homers and 103 RBI, both his most since 2019. Heading into this NLDS, Yelich is once again a power threat at the plate. If Milwaukee wants to get to the NLCS, the face of the franchise needs to be at his best to help the Brewers get there.How they winCubs:The Cubs showed in their series-clinching win over the Padres thattheir offense still knows how to put pressure on pitchers. They put together lengthy at-bats, got contributions throughout their lineup and rediscovered their power stroke. If the Cubs beat the Brewers in the NLDS, it will be because their offense is superior to Milwaukee’s. When the Cubs were at their best this season, their offense was the driving force, and if it can be that again, this team has more than enough firepower to make things uncomfortable for the Brewers.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBrewers:When the Brewers are at their best, it’s a combination of strong starting pitching, pesky offense and stout defense that separates them from the pack. One of the Brewers’ biggest advantages is that “postseason baseball” — in which taking the extra base, forcing the issue to scratch across extra runs and playing strong defense are critical — is their normal style of play. The Brewers can win this series if they play their game.Series prediction: Brewers in 5What makes Cubs-Brewers such an interesting and entertaining series is that the two teams know each other so well. This is rival against rival, with a trip to the NLCS on the line. Because of that, this series has all the ingredients to go the distance, and in a series that close, something small will be the difference, whether that’s Milwaukee’s tight playing style or Chicago’s boosted confidence. Expect this series to be tight in every regard, but in the end, Milwaukee has a slight advantage.— Dorsey",

The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currentlybuilding an AI device, asocial media app, andan AI-powered browserto take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model,GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents calledthe GPT Store. Altman wasousted as CEOdays later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as anAPI for AI voice applications, but not much else.Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched last year.TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.Techcrunch eventJoin 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.Update 10/3/25: OpenAI updated the attendee list for DevDay 2025.

(NYSE: KLC) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement issued in connection with KinderCare’s October 2024 initial public offering (the “IPO”), of the important October 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.SO WHAT: If you purchased KinderCare common stock you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the KinderCare class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43769or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or emailcase@rosenlegal.comfor more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the registration statement was false and/or misleading and/or failed to disclose that: (1) numerous incidents of child abuse, neglect, and harm had occurred at KinderCare facilities; (2) KinderCare did not provide the “highest quality care possible” at its facilities, and, indeed, in numerous instances had failed to provide even basic care, meet minimum standards in the child care industry, or comply with the laws and regulations governing the care of children; and (3) as a result, KinderCare was exposed to a material, undisclosed risk of lawsuits, adverse regulatory action, negative publicity, reputational damage, and business loss. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the KinderCare class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43769or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or emailcase@rosenlegal.comfor more information.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter:https://twitter.com/rosen_firmor on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.Attorney Advertising.

That was an easy beat to Wall Street’s expectations of 27 cents a share. Total revenues were up 1.1 percent to $11.72 billion, besting analysts’ average forecast of $10.99 billion.Related StoriesNike's Air Max 95 OG Big Bubble Sneaker Is Getting a Gucci-Inspired Collaboration From UndefeatedOutdoor Retailer Has a Fresh Mindset -- and New Location in MinneapolisTD Cowen’s John Kernan said thatNike’s first quarter sales and earnings per share beat should be viewed as another building block towards a turnaround — with the next catalysts dependent on intra-quarter datapoints on average selling prices, digital traffic and retail partner results. (The Swoosh will report second-quarter results in December.)You May Also LikeNike earlier this year introduced new products, among them a revamped Vomero line that saw Vomero 18 surpass $100 million in sales. It was a notable win for the Swoosh that saw specialty retailers confirming this summer that theNike Running comebackwas very much on. The big question was always whether Nike sustain the new momentum?CEO Elliott Hill on Tuesday raised the stakes when he told analysts during a conference call that the company redirected 8,000 employees to its new marketing and operating initiative. Called Sport Offense, the theory is to align its three brands — Nike, Jordan and Converse — into teams by sport that should help the company give each brand its own distinct identity through innovative storytelling and connecting with the communities of  athletes who buy Nike’s product.Hill said the early read was good, withNorth America leadingthe Win Now turnaround. And he said that while there were wins in performancerunning, the CEO acknowledged that there are other areas — such as sportswear, China and Nike Direct — that also require some attention.Drake MacFarlane, research analyst at M Science, said that with Nike going back into performance running, particularly towards a premium product, the company’s now challenging key competitors, including On, Hoka, and New Balance.“We know that Nike has been trying to reengage with retailers in thewholesalechannel for awhile,” he said, noting that it appears that the company has done some discounting to incentivize retailers to reengage with the brand.That could be a problem particularly for On, according to Jefferies analyst Randal Konik. “This renewed momentum and retailer confidence suggest On could face mounting pressure to sustain its elevatedwholesalegrowth, as Nike’s innovation and channel strategy reclaim share and reset competitive dynamics,” he explained, noting that Nike has redesigned key models and is introducing at least one major running style each season.And on the way this month are two major releases forNike Running and Nike Basketball, the Vomero Premium and the LeBron 23, respectively. “This resurgence in running is not just a product story, it’s a strategic realignment that’s resonating with consumers and retailers alike,” the Jefferies analyst said. For On, which has built its brandon runningfootwear, Nike’s renewed momentum signals a tougher competitive landscape and a direct challenge to On’s growth narrative.”Konik said that Nike’s aggressive management of its classic franchises — Air Force 1, Dunk and Jordan 1 — plus the resetting of Converse, could hurt On, which has “largely benefited from rapid sell-in and expansion in Nike’s absence.” And with Nike’s disciplined approach to inventory and channel management, the company’s challenging “On’s wholesale trajectory for the first time,” Konik said.Daily Headlinessubscribe",

        "text": "TeslaTesla CybertruckLawsuit blames Cybertruck door handles for death of three teens in Tesla crashJameson Dow| Oct 3 2025 - 12:35 pm PT87 CommentsPhoto:California Highway PatrolTwo Bay Area families are suing Tesla over the death of their 19-year-old daughter and 20-year-old son after a crash which left them and one other teenager dead, trapped inside the vehicle due to what the lawsuit alleges is poor door handle design.The lawsuit traces back to a 2024 crash on Thanksgiving Eve in Piedmont, California, where a Cybertruck carrying four college students crashed into a tree and a wall, causing a fire. As a result of the crash, the Cybertruck’s electronic door handles no longer worked, and the passengers were trapped inside.A surveillance video released by the California Highway Patrol showed the Cybertruck’s final moments, rounding a curve at high speed and seeming to lose control of the rear of the vehicle as it crested a hill, with a large flash seen in the video after the Cybertruck leaves the frame.A friend in another vehicle that had been following the Cybertruck stopped and managed to break the front passenger window after “ten to fifteen hits” with a fallen tree branch and pull one passenger out of the vehicle, but the other three passengersdied inside of asphyxia from smoke inhalationand had burns on their body.Advertisement - scroll for more contentTesla vehicles typically do receive high scores for passenger safety in crash tests, and Tesla has touted its “armor glass” as being hard to break (despite a famously failed demo at theCybertruck’s introduction). And it appears that the occupants did not die from the crash impact itself, but rather from being trapped inside and the resulting smoke and burns.Krystal Tsukahara, 19Jack Nelson, 20Soren Dixon, 19Photos: City of PiedmontThe three college students who died were 19 year old Krysta Tsukarahara and Soren Dixon, and 20 year old Jack Nelson. Dixon had been driving the vehicle, and post-crash investigations discovered that all three had been under the influence at the time of the crash. All were high school friends home from college for Thanksgiving and had spent the night out together on what is known to beone of the worst drunk driving nights of the year.After the crash, Tsukahara’s familyfiled a lawsuit against the estate of Dixon, the driver of the car. The car belonged to Dixon’s relative.The Tsukaharas have now amended their case to include Tesla as a defendant after post-crash investigations suggested the car’s design contributed to the deaths, blaming door handles that are difficult to operate and doors and windows that are hard for rescuers to access for their child’s death. Nelson’s family filed a separate lawsuit, with the same allegation.Tesla’s door handles in focusTesla vehicles have electronic door handles, with outer door handles that are flush against the vehicle. This enhances the sleek look of the exterior, and also leads to small aerodynamic gains.However, it also leads to confusing operation, as each car the company has released so far has had a different door handle in a different place on the vehicle with a different method of operation than the last.This also means that the outer door handles can be hard to operate in an emergency situation. In the crash described above, the rescuer had to bash at the Cybertruck’s window “ten to fifteen” times, after having failed to punch it out with his fist. An externally operable door handle would have perhaps resulted in a different outcome.Further, the interior door release can be confusing in an emergency situation. Normally one just presses the interior door release button, which operates electronically. However, when there’s a problem with the vehicle, that system can become disconnected and require a manual release.Every Tesla has a manual release, but it’s often hidden in a place that passengers may not know to look, or may have difficulty finding in an emergency scenario, especially for rear seat passengers.On the Cybertruck, the front manual door release is relatively easy to access, just in front of the window switches. Indeed, sometimes passengers will accidentally pull this lever rather than the electronic door release (which is not recommended, as it can damage the window trim). In the event of this crash, at least one passenger was described as “barely conscious,” and thus operation of the door handle may not have been an option.Front manual door releaseRear manual door release, step 1Rear manual door release, step 2Cybertruck’s manual door releases. From Tesla’sCybertruck owners manualBut the rear release is much harder to find. To access it, one must remove a rubber mat from the map pocket, revealing a mechanical release cable with a loop on the end, then pull it forward.Tsukahara’s parents say that she “was alive after the crash. She called out for help. And she couldn’t get out.” It is conceivable that simpler door handles may have resulted in a different outcome, though three of the vehicle’s doors were obstructed by the wall and tree that it had crashed into. The right rear door, the seat occupied by Nelson, was unobstructed, according to the Nelsons’ lawsuit.Tesla’s other cars have similarly hidden mechanical door releases in the rear,under carpet under the seat in the Model S,under the map pocket in the Model 3andModel Y, orbehind the speaker grille in the Model X.These designs have resulted in criticism, and have been the focus of government agencies recently. Tesla is currentlybeing investigated by the NHTSAover its door handle design, and Tesla has confirmed that it isfinally redesigning its handles.Elsewhere in the world, Chinese auto regulators aremulling a ban on retractable door handles, as many sleek new EVs have taken on the trend that Tesla started with its flush door handles.There have been several lawsuits against Tesla for deaths in its vehicles, often associated with the company’s Autopilot or Full Self-Driving systems. The company typically chooses to settle these lawsuits out of court, despite CEO Elon Musk stating “we will never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose,” though it didrefuse to settlea recent case and ended up with a$243 million judgmentagainst it, in the first Tesla ADAS case that reached trial.While this crash had nothing to do with the company’s driver assist systems, it will be interesting to see how Tesla responds to this lawsuit.The two cases are Nelson v Tesla Inc. and Tsukahara v Dixon, both filed in the California Superior Court in Alameda County. Tsukahara’s case has been set for trial in February 2027.Electrek’s TakeWhen I was in high school, a very similar accident happened. A large SUV was speeding around a curve, lost control, and rolled. The teenagers inside were under the influence, though the driver wasn’t in this case. It was national news, and significantly affected our community.Many other communities have felt the same. It’s a common story. And yet, we still keep building these giant, lumbering land yachts, thinking that it enhances safety whenit does not.But that’s somewhat of an aside here. If the Cybertruck were more nimble or less “impenetrable,” maybe the crash results would have been different. But the focus on door handles is one simple, clear change that would have saved lives in this instance.Tesla has always had weird door handles, and the door handles have always ended up causing some sort of problem. Whether it be overly complicated latches which make repair costly as in the Model S, overly complicated door which delay release like the Model X, oddly-placed manual door releases that can cause abnormal wear on the Model 3 and Y, or even the svelte door handles on my original Roadster which are currently giving me a weird problem I can’t even explain here, this is a pattern.Top comment byJameson DowLiked by 15 peopleIf you mock dead children, you will be IP banned. This is retroactive.View all commentsAnd the pattern doesn’t just apply to door handles, but to much of how Tesla works as a company, with the “move fast and break things” approach common in technology. While Tesla has been innovative, those innovations sometimes have come with less consideration for safety than they perhaps should have.Now, with these Cybertruck deaths, maybe we can finally get a little reason and have Tesla be more normal with its door handles, at least.The 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

I struggle with it all the time, and I'm a professional. That's because every story is different and presents its own unique blend of frustrations and challenges.I set out to make a hub that screenwriters could flock to, no matter the level they're at, to get a crash course in all the things that go into writing a script.Whether you're a pro who's stuck or just typing the first pages of your first idea, I wanted this to be a page to bookmark and go back to as needed.Think of this as your foundational glossary—a hub of essential terms, concepts, and tools you'll need from the first spark of an idea to that final, polished draft.Each term is hyperlinked to direct you to a more in-depth examination of the term itself.You can start withhow to write a screenplayor ourfree screenwriting bookand go from there.Let's dive in.The Idea & ConceptThis is where it all begins. A strong foundation isn't just about a good idea; it's about understanding how to shape that idea into a viable story for the big screen.Logline: A one or two-sentence summary of your film. Its purpose is twofold: to serve as a north star during your writing process and to act as a sales tool when pitching. A professionalloglinemust contain four key elements:Protagonist: Who is your hero, and what defines them? (e.g., \"A cynical weatherman...\")Inciting Incident: What event kicks the story into gear? (...is forced to relive the same day over and over...)Obstacles: What stands in their way? (...and win the heart of his producer.\")High Concept:This refers to a story idea that is immediately understandable and marketable. Its \"hook\" is so clear you can grasp the entire premise in a single sentence. Think of it as a \"what if\" question: What if dinosaurs were brought back to life in a theme park? (Jurassic Park). What if a liar were forced to tell the truth? (Liar Liar). High-concept films often have a built-in audience and are easier to pitch. This is the opposite of alow-conceptorcharacter-drivenstory, which relies more on nuanced character exploration than a plot hook (e.g.,Manchester by the Sea).Theme: The central argument or underlying message of your story. It’s what your story isreallyabout. Theme is not plot; it's the idea exploredthroughthe plot. Rather than stating your theme, you should explore it through athematic question. ForJaws, the thematic question might be, \"Does a community value public safety over economic prosperity?\" The film argues its theme by showing the tragic consequences of the mayor's greedy choices. Theme is best expressed through character arcs, choices, and the story's ultimate resolution.Treatment: A prose document that tells the story of your screenplay from beginning to end in the present tense. It's more detailed than anoutline, often including key moments of dialogue and describing the emotional tone of scenes. A \"short treatment\" might be 5-10 pages, while a detailed \"long treatment\" can be 30-60 pages. Producers often request a treatment to see if they are interested in the full story before committing to reading a 110-page script.Outline: Your architectural blueprint. While a treatment is in prose, an outline is a scene-by-scene skeleton of the plot. Popular outlining methods include:Index Card Method: Each card represents one scene, allowing you to easily rearrange, add, or discard scenes to find the best structure.Beat Sheet: Popularized by books like Blake Snyder'sSave the Cat!, this method provides a template of 15 key story \"beats\" (Opening Image,Inciting Incident, Midpoint, etc.) and the approximate page numbers where they should fall. (Resource:An Introduction to the Save the Cat!Beat Sheet)Formatting & StructureProper screenplay formattingis non-negotiable. It is the language of production, ensuring that every department, from the director to the line producer, can break down your script.Slugline: This tells the production team everything they need to know to schedule and budget a scene.INT.means it's a controlled (and often cheaper) environment.EXT.means battling the elements (weather, light, sound). The Location is for the art department, and the Time of Day is crucial for the Director of Photography and scheduling. You can also use more specific times likeDUSK,SUNRISE, orLATERif the exact time is important.Action Line: This is your prose. Ideally, you write only what can be seen and heard, but you candevelop your own voice.Parenthetical: A small direction for an actor, placed in parentheses. Its purpose is to clarify an action or intention that is not obvious from the dialogue. Overusing them is a classic amateur mistake. It implies you don't trust your dialogue, actor, or director to convey the meaning.Three-Act Structure: This is the DNA of most commercial films. Understanding its key \"beats\" will give you a powerful map for your story.Act I: The Setup(≈ p. 1-30): We meet theprotagonistin their ordinary world. TheInciting Incident (linked earlier)(≈ p. 10-12) occurs, disrupting their life and presenting a goal. The act ends with theBreak into Act Two(≈ p. 25-30), where the hero makes a decision and actively begins their journey.Act II: The Confrontation(≈ p. 30-90): This is the longest act, where the protagonist faces escalating obstacles. A major event, theMidpoint(≈ p. 55-60), often changes the hero's approach or raises the stakes dramatically. The act culminates in theAll Is Lost moment(≈ p. 85-90), where the hero is at their lowest point and defeat seems certain.Act III: The Resolution(≈ p. 90-120): The hero rallies and confronts theantagonistin theClimax. This is followed by theFalling Action, which shows the immediate aftermath, and theFinal Image, a single shot that serves as an inverse of the Opening Image, demonstrating the character's change.The Writing ProcessThese are the conceptual tools you'll use while crafting your scenes and sequences.Beat: The smallest unit of change in a scene. A scene is a series of beats. Think of it as an action/reaction cycle. If a character enters a scene wanting one thing and leaves wanting something else (or having achieved/failed to achieve it), the scene has \"turned\" through a series of beats.Sequence: A collection of scenes (typically 3-5) that function as a self-contained mini-story within the larger narrative. For example, in a spy movie, the \"Infiltrating the Gala\" sequence might include scenes of the spy getting ready, arriving at the party, distracting the guards, cracking the safe, and escaping. It has a clear beginning, middle, and end.Subtext: The true meaning simmering beneath the words. People rarely say exactly what they mean, and great dialogue reflects this. Subtext is created by the gap between what a charactersaysand what theydo,feel, ortruly want.Example: InThe Empire Strikes Back, when Leia says, \"I love you,\" Han Solo replies, \"I know.\" The text is simple, but the subtext is rich with their entire history of banter, conflict, and unspoken affection. It perfectly encapsulates his cocky yet loving character. (Resource:The Art of Subtext: Making Your Dialogue Sing)Exposition: The delivery of crucial background information. The challenge is to deliver it gracefully without boring the audience. This is often called an \"info dump.\"Smart ways to deliver exposition include:Conflict: Two characters argue about a past event, revealing information naturally.In Medias Res: Start in the middle of the action and let the audience piece the backstory together from contextual clues.Characters & DialogueYour characters are the engine of your story. Their desires and flaws drive the plot forward.Protagonist&Antagonist: Your protagonist must beactive. They must make decisions and drive the story. The antagonist is the primary obstacle to the protagonist's goal. The most compelling antagonists don't see themselves as evil; they believe they are the hero of their own story and have a logical, even sympathetic, reason for their actions.Character Arc: The internal journey of transformation a character undergoes. The plot is the external journey; the arc is the internal one. There are three main types:Positive Arc: The character overcomes a fatal flaw and grows into a better version of themselves (e.g., Ebenezer Scrooge).Negative Arc: The character succumbs to their flaws or external pressures and ends in a worse state (e.g., Michael Corleone inThe Godfather).Flat Arc: The character does not change. Instead, their unwavering belief system changes the worldaroundthem (e.g., Captain America, James Bond).\"On the Nose\" Dialogue: Dialogue that is too literal, stating exactly what a character is thinking or feeling. It lacks subtext and feels unnatural.On the Nose:SARAH: I'm so sad that my father passed away.With Subtext:SARAH: My dad always loved this park in the fall. I haven't been back since he passed.The second version reveals the same information but through memory and emotion, making it more powerful.Revising & PolishingWriting is rewriting. Your first draft is just you telling yourself the story. The real art happens in the drafts that follow. ✍️Page One Rewrite: A complete overhaul of your script. Instead of just editing your existing document, you open a blank page and start again fromFADE IN:, using your previous draft as a memory guide. This liberating process forces you to re-evaluate every scene, character, and plot point, helping you escape \"first draft inertia.\"Table Read:An invaluable diagnostic tool. Hearing your words spoken aloud by actors (or even just friends) immediately reveals what's not working. You'll hear clunky dialogue, identify pacing issues, and spot confusing plot points. Listen more than you talk, and take copious notes.Script Coverage: A formal analysis performed by a professional \"script reader.\" The standard deliverable is 2-4 pages of feedback, including a logline, a full synopsis, and a critique of key areas like Plot, Character, Dialogue, and Concept. While studio coverage is used to filter scripts, paid coverage services are development tools for writers seeking objective feedback.Polish: The final pass. This is not about story; it's about prose. The goal is to make the read as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Hunt down typos and formatting errors. Trim action lines, strengthen your verbs, and cut any word, line, or scene that doesn't absolutely need to be there.The Business of ScreenwritingA great script is only half the battle. Understanding the industry is crucial to getting your work seen.Query Letter: A professional, one-page email used to solicit a read from a manager or producer. It's a sales document. The standard structure is:A brief, personalized opening (if possible).Your script's genre and title.Your killer, one-sentence logline.A short, exciting 2-3 sentence pitch expanding on the logline.A brief bio highlighting any relevant credentials (awards, previous work).A polite closing.Representation: This is a critical distinction.Agentsare state-licensed professionals who procure work and negotiate contracts for a 10% commission. They are the deal-makers.Managersare career developers. They provide creative feedback, help you develop a slate of projects, and use their relationships to connect you with producers and agents. They typically take a 10-15% commission. Most new writers secure a manager first.The Annual Black List: A prestigious survey of Hollywood executives' favorite unproduced scripts of the year.The Black List websiteis a paid service where writers can host their scripts and purchase evaluations from professional readers. High scores on the website can get your script noticed by industry professionals.Spec Script: A \"speculative\" script written without a contract or payment. You write it \"on spec\" in the hope of either selling the script outright or using it as a writing sample to land an \"assignment\"—a paid job writing a script for a studio or production company. For a new writer, your spec script is your calling card.Summing It All UpScreenwriting is a marathon. Every writer, from the novice to the Oscar winner, starts with these same building blocks.

Roswell Park is listed as participating in all of Univera Healthcare’s Medicare Advantage plans.“We really believe that we provide very high quality care, and are very concerned about patients not having access to this care, particularly this vulnerable population over the age of 65 who are, honestly, more likely to develop cancer over the next 10, 15, 20 years,” Roswell Park Chief Medical Officer Dr. Julia Faller told The Buffalo News on Friday.It is key information for seniors, especially those receiving cancer treatment, to know as they head into open enrollment, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.In a message to Roswell Park employees Thursday, President and CEO Candace S. Johnson explained that the cancer center was recently informed that Independent Health “designed their 2026 Individual Medicare Advantage products to put more financial burden on our patients, shifting more cost to the community we care for and away from Independent Health.”“This decision creates financial and emotional stress for patients who are already facing the challenges of cancer,” Johnson wrote. “We believe that cost should never be a barrier to receiving quality care and service, and we could not in good conscience participate in a plan that would put our patients and community at risk for financial harm.”In her message, Johnson said that Roswell Park is launching a communications plan that will inform the community about the changes, including outreach to patients to explain their options during Medicare’s open enrollment period.Independent Health respondsIn a statement, Independent Health said it had been working with Roswell Park on a new agreement to continue as a participating provider in its individual Medicare Advantage plans for 2026.“Unfortunately, despite extensive negotiations, Roswell Park chose not to participate in our individual Medicare Advantage plans starting January 1, 2026,” the health plan said, noting that Roswell Park will still participate in Independent Health’s group Medicare plans, as well as commercial, state and self-funded lines of business.In discussions with Independent Health, Faller said Roswell Park didn’t feel as though “there was an option for us to negotiate with them on this particular topic.”“We couldn’t move forward with any agreement that meant that our patients are going to face much higher cost,” Faller said. “They basically told us, ‘This is what we are offering you,’ and that wasn’t something that we felt comfortable with. We didn’t feel it was fair. It wasn’t right, and it’s just not in line with the quality of care that we want to make sure our patients receive.”Independent Health reports a $66 million loss for last year, a big improvement from 2023Despite the loss, it is a big improvement for Independent Health compared to 2023, when the insurer recorded a net loss of about $193 million on revenues of $2.3 billion.Independent Health’s individual Medicare Advantage members will have access to a network of oncology providers that includes Buffalo Medical Group, Catholic Health, Great Lakes Cancer Care Collaborative (which includes Erie County Medical Center, Kaleida Health and UBMD, among others) and Wilmot Cancer Institute at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester.In Medicare Advantage, the government pays private insurers – such as Independent Health, Highmark or Univera – to operate approved health insurance plans for those 65 and older as an alternative to what is often referred to as “traditional Medicare.” In 2023, 49% of Medicare beneficiaries opted to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans, a percentage that has been growing quickly in the last decade,according to The Commonwealth Fund.Changes to Medicare AdvantageWhile Medicare Advantage plans have been historically lucrative for insurers, that appears to be changing.Just this week,Reuters reportedthat massive insurers UnitedHealth, Humana and CVS Health are pulling back on Medicare Advantage offerings for 2026 as the profitability of those plans wanes. Since 2024, Reuters reported, the U.S. government has been scaling back payments in Medicare Advantage as it tries to cut spending.In reporting a $66 million loss for 2024, Independent Health noted that changes to the Medicare Advantage program reduced reimbursements by about 3%. Despite the challenges, Independent Health last year grew membership in its Medicare Advantage business.Highmark Western and Northeastern New York, the local affiliate of Pittsburgh-based Highmark Health, reported a net loss of $140 million in 2024, on revenue of $3 billion. Highmark attributed $106 million – about 75% of the total loss – to its Medicare Advantage business due to increased use and federal changes, which included increases in hospital payments, a cap on out-of-pocket expenses for members and government reimbursement rates that stayed flat.In a statement Friday, Highmark said increased health care costs, driven by expensive new drugs and increased medical utilization, have outpaced the rate of federal reimbursement in the last three years.In addition, a federal change to the Medicare Wage Index led to substantially higher hospital payments for upstate New York hospitals, further widening the gap between health care costs and the revenue provided to health plans to provide this coverage, Highmark noted.While Highmark had to make changes to its Medicare Advantage plan options for 2026, it said it worked with Roswell Park to ensure the cancer center’s participation in several of its offerings. Roswell Park will participate in Highmark’s 2026 individual Medicare Advantage Senior Blue HMO plans, Forever Blue PPO and Freedom Blue PPO plans. It will not be participating in Highmark’s 2026 Community Blue individual Medicare HMO plans.“Highmark made the decision to maintain Roswell Park as a participating provider in MA products with monthly premiums that more adequately cover the cost of their services,” said Highmark, noting that Roswell Park is in network in all other Highmark plans offered to Medicare Group retirees, large and small businesses and individuals.Rochester-based Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, which includes Univera Healthcare, reported an operating loss last year of $163 million on revenue of $6.5 billion. But strong investment results offset the loss, allowing Excellus to post a profit of $25.6 million.With the change to the Medicare Wage Index, Excellus last year reimbursed hospitals $100 million more for Medicare Advantage members, but the insurer did not see an increase in government funding. The health plan’s Medicare Advantage products lost more than $200 million last year due to the wage index changes and increases in health care costs.For more information on Medicare coverage at Roswell Park, patients can visitwww.roswellpark.org/innetwork.Jon Harris can be reached at 716-849-3482 orjharris@buffnews.com.

(Photo by ALLISON ROBBERT/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty ImagesTimelineFriday, Oct. 3The Senate rejected a GOP-backed bill to avert a shutdown until at least Nov. 21 in a 54-44 vote—failing to reach the 60 votes required to advance—and also voted down the Democratic proposal.Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Chris Coons, D-Conn., did not vote for the GOP bill, while Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. and Angus King, I-Maine, voted with Republicans in favor of the legislation, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. voted alongside Democrats against it.Earlier Friday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters they wouldn’t negotiate with Democrats on their demands to extend tax credits in the Affordable Care Act in exchange for their votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold.Friday, Oct. 3The September labor market report was put on hold as the BLS is closed due to the shutdown.Friday, Oct. 3White House budget chief Russ Voughtannounced$2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago infrastructure projects—extension of the Red line and modernization of the Red and Purple lines—was “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”It’s the latest move by the White House targeting federal funding in a Democratic-led state as it seeks to pressure Senate Democrats to vote alongside Republicans for a new federal funding plan that would lift the shutdown.Thursday, Oct. 2Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters senators would not vote over the weekend on a funding plan to avert a shutdown, meaning it would likely last until at least Monday.Thursday, Oct. 2Trump doubled down on threats to punish Democrats for withholding their votes on legislation to avert a shutdown, announcing he would meet with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,”he wroteon Truth Social.Wednesday, Oct. 1Vought said the Office of Management and Budget was canceling $8 billion in Biden-era energy projects “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in states won by Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, including Colorado, California, New Jersey and New York, though it’s unclear what projects specifically will be affected.Wednesday, Oct. 1Vought also warned in a call with House Republicans on Wednesday other infrastructure projects in New York, home to Congress’ top Democratic leaders, are under review and said the government could begin permanent layoffs due to the shutdown in a matter of days,Politico reported, citing four anonymous sources.Wednesday, Oct. 1The administration alsohalted$18 billion in funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects—the Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway—to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” Vought said, with the Department of Transportation warning a review of the funding could take longer due to the shutdown.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has preserved some of its key priorities during the shutdown, including construction of a White House ballroom, an unnamed administration official toldABC News, claiming the project is not funded by congressional appropriations, while offices that handle tariffs and immigration enforcement will retain more staffing than in previous shutdowns, according toPolitico analysisof internal government documents.ContraVice President JD Vance rejected the notion the Trump administration was purposely maneuvering funding to punish Democrats, telling reporters during a White House briefing Wednesday “we’re not targeting federal agencies based on politics.” Though House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., contradicting Vance, said Wednesday during a press conference “the longer this goes on, the more pain will be inflicted” and told radio host Moon Griffon the shutdown could “benefit” Republicans by allowing them to make additional cuts to the federal workforce.Why Did The Government Shut Down?The Senate on Tuesday failed to approve Republican-backed legislation known as a “continuing resolution” that would stave off a shutdown by allowing the government to operate under its existing budget through Nov. 21. The Republican-backed measure was rejected in a 55-45 vote, which fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate, with three members of the Democratic caucus voting alongside Republicans, marking the second time in a matter of weeks the plan has failed in the Senate. The House already passed the GOP-backed proposal in a 217-212 vote, but it needs the support of at least seven Democrats to move through the Senate. The Senate on Wednesday rejected for a third time Republicans’ plan to keep the government open in a 55-45 vote and also voted 53-47 against a Democratic proposal. The major factor dividing Republicans and Democrats is Democrats’ demand for an extension of federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have accused Democrats of forcing a shutdown and alleged they want undocumented immigrants to have access to public healthcare benefits (though they’re not legally allowed to).How Long Will The Shutdown Last?There were some signs negotiations were progressing as of Wednesday afternoon. A bipartisan group of senators huddled on the Senate floor to discuss an alternative to the failed GOP funding plan, with the possibility of offering some healthcare-related concessions to Democrats, Politicoreported, citing several senators involved in the discussions. The Senate is out of session Thursday for Yom Kippur and the next vote on legislation to reopen the government isn’t expected until Friday. Vance predicted Wednesday the shutdown wouldn’t last “that long” but placed the onus on Democrats, while continuing to falsely claim they want to provide illegal immigrants with free healthcare.What Is Closed During A Government Shutdown?The Congressional Budget Office said 750,000 workers could be furloughed daily in a shutdown, with their compensation totaling $400 million, in aletterTuesday to Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. Several agencies have said they will furlough more than half their workers, including the Environmental Protection Agency (89%), the Education Department (87%) and Commerce (81%), according toThe New York Times.Key economic data collection activieis from the Labor Department will also be suspended, meaning Friday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics report on nonfarm payroll growth, its weekly report on jobless claims released each Thursday and potentially the next consumer price index report scheduled for Oct. 15 will not be released. Some federal agencies, such as the federal housing administration, a division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would stop processing new loans, and routine inspections by the Food and Drug Administration and EPA would be curtailed or stopped. Some contracts and grants, including those from the National Institutes of Health to fund research at outside organizations, such as universities, will freeze. In the previous shutdown, some air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officials stopped showing up for work after weeks without pay, causing flight delays at major airports.What Stays Open During A Government Shutdown?Mandatory programs, such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, veterans’ disability and pension payments and federal student loans will continue making payments. Food assistance programs, including SNAP and the federal program to assist women, infants and children, are also exempt, “subject to the availability of funding,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculturecontingency plan. Other programs funded by fees, rather than annual congressional appropriations, will also operate normally, including the U.S. Postal Service and passport and visa processing. Essential employees, including active military personnel and air traffic controllers, are required to continue working. Some activities related to public health, including monitoring for disease outbreaks and foodborne illness, are also exempt from the shutdown. National parks will remain open, but most National Park Service staff will be furloughed, with the exception of personnel performing “activities necessary to protect life and property” and those required by law, such as law enforcement and emergency response, and protection of federal lands and property within the National Park System, according toInterior Department Guidance.The Smithsonian Institution said its museums and National Zoo will remain open through at least Oct. 6 using funding from the previous year. The Internal Revenue Service willalso continue operating normallyfor the first five days of the government shutdown using previously allocated funding from the Inflation Reduction Act.What Have Democratic Leaders Said After The Shutdown Went Into Effect?In apost on X, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote: “IT’S MIDNIGHT. That means the Republican shutdown has just begun because they wouldn’t protect Americans’ health care. We’re going to keep fighting for the American people.” Schumer also issued a joint statement with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.,which read: “After months of making life harder and more expensive, Donald Trump and Republicans have now shut down the federal government because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people...Over the last few days, President Trump's behavior has become more erratic and unhinged. Instead of negotiating a bipartisan agreement in good faith, he is obsessively posting crazed deepfake videos.” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.,tweeted: “MAGA’s government shutdown was totally avoidable, and I will keep fighting hard to get government back open.” Rep. Jasmine Crocket, D-Texas.,wrote: “Make no mistake: Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. This is THEIR shutdown. They had every tool to govern and chose chaos instead.”What Have Repulican Leaders Said After The Shutdown Began?In anX post, Johnson, wrote: Democrats have officially voted to CLOSE the government. Results: Moms and kids now lose WIC nutrition. Veterans lose health care and suicide prevention programs. FEMA has shortfalls during hurricane season. Soldiers and TSA agents go UNPAID. The only question now: How long will Chuck Schumer let this pain go on — for his own selfish reasons?” The White House’s official website nowdisplaysa government shutdown clock and a running chyron which says: “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government.” Trump hasn’t posted anything since the shutdown began, but earlier on Tuesday night, he shared another alteredvideomocking Jeffries by overlaying a mustache and sombrero over his face, similar to an AI generated deepfake heposted on Monday night.What Else Has Trump Said About A Government Shutdown?Trump told Politico “I don’t worry about that” in aninterviewpublished Tuesday whether he fears Americans will blame Republicans for a shutdown. Calling Democrats “deranged,” Trump claimed they “want to destroy healthcare in America by giving it to millions and millions of illegal aliens,” referring to Democrats’ proposal to undo provisions of Trump’s signature policy bill passed earlier this year that would block some noncitizens from public health benefits, according to Politico. Most undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare, or purchase coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. On Monday, following their meeting, Trumppostedan AI-generated video showing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y, with a sombrero and a mustache standing next to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as he claims Democrats want to give healthcare to “all these illegal aliens . . . so they can vote for us,” prompting Jeffries to call the video “disgusting” and Schumer to accuse Republicans of throwing “tantrums.” Trump has also repeatedly brought up gender-affirming healthcare in discussing the government shutdown—telling reporters last week “if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down,” alleging Democrats “want to have transgender for everybody,” calling them “crazy.” It’s unclear what he’s referring to.Politico notessome Trump allies argue that an extension of federal tax credits in the Affordable Care Act, which Democrats insist on, continues taxpayer support for gender-affirming healthcare, since five states require insurance to cover some services.How Have Republicans Threatened To Blame Democrats For A Shutdown?Trump threatened Democrats on Tuesday that the federal government could “do things during the shutdown that are irreversible . . . medically and other ways, including benefits, we can cut large numbers of people,” warning the GOP was prepared to blame Democrats for the permanent reductions and predicting a shutdown is “probably likely” but not “inevitable.” The Office of Management and Budget also instructed federal agencies in a memo last week to formulate plans for mass layoffs if the government shuts down by identifying programs whose discretionary funding expire on Oct. 1, along with those that don’t align with Trump’s agenda. The move was widely viewed as a way to exact maximum pain on Democrats if they refuse to agree to Republicans’ proposal to avert a shutdown by setting the stage to blame them for staffing reductions. Schumer called the threat to fire federal workers if the government shuts down “an attempt at intimidation” in a statement.How Did The Senate Vote The First Time Around?The Senate on Sept. 19 rejected proposals from both Republicans and Democrats to keep the government open, with the Republican plan failing in a 44-48 vote, short of the 60 needed to break the filibuster. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., voted alongside Republicans to approve their plan to continue the existing budget through Nov. 21, while Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, were the only two Republicans to vote against it. The Democratic plan was rejected 47-45, with seven Republican senators missing the vote.TangentDemocratscould benefit politicallyfrom forcing a shutdown, according to political experts, who have noted it’s one of the few tools they have to counter Republicans, who control all three branches of government, since the GOP needs at least seven Democratic votes to move the legislation through the Senate. It’s a risky move as shutdowns aregenerally unpopularwith voters.Key BackgroundIn recent previous shutdown negotiations, a small coalition of right-wing Republicans have threatened to withhold their votes if the new spending plan doesn’t adhere to their demands, while Democrats have typically been averse to shutdowns. Democrats, polling at their lowest level in history, according toGallup, have a unique opportunity to use the shutdown negotiations as a show of resistance to the Trump administration, and potentially pave a way for the party to rebuild its image ahead of next year’s midterm elections.Surprising FactThe last time the government shut down, during Trump’s first term in December 2018, it was the longest shutdown on record, lasting 35 days. At the center of the dispute was Trump’s demand for more border wall funding, which he eventually abandoned to allow the government to reopen.Big Number$1 billion. That’s how much disruptions in air and rail travel and national parks and museum closures could cost the economy during a shutdown,according to tourism officials.Further ReadingTrump Calls Off Meeting With Democrats: Blasts ‘Ridiculous Demands’(Forbes)White House Budget Office Threatens Mass Firings If Government Shutdown Happens(Forbes)Democrats Could Benefit From A Government Shutdown—Here’s Why(Forbes)Government Shutdown Would Cost U.S. Travel Economy $1 Billion Per Week, Say Industry Officials—Here’s What To Expect(Forbes)Got a tip?

        "text": "RBC Capital adjusts its rating for Close Brothers Group PLC (OTC:CBGPY) to \"Sector Perform\" and lowers the price target amid concerns over future profitability. The company reports a pre-tax loss of &pound;122 million for the year, with a notable decline in net interest margin (NIM) to below 7%. Despite financial challenges, Close Brothers achieves an annual profit of &pound;144.3 million, exceeding market expectations through effective cost-saving measures and selective lending. Close Brothers Group PLC, trading as OTC:CBGPY, is a British financial services company. It offers a range of services, including lending, wealth management, and securities trading. The company faces competition from other UK banks and financial institutions. On October 3, 2025, RBC Capital adjusted its rating for CBGPY to \"Sector Perform,\" maintaining a \"hold\" action, with the stock priced at $13.08. RBC Capital also revised the price target for Close Brothers, lowering it from 525 GBp to 500 GBp. This adjustment comes amid concerns about the company's future profitability. Close Brothers recently warned that its net interest margin (NIM) is expected to fall below 7% in the coming year, down from 7.2% last year. This decline has contributed to a 5% drop in the share price. The company's financial performance has been challenging. For the year ending in July, Close Brothers reported a pre-tax loss of &pound;122 million, compared to a &pound;133 million profit the previous year. The adjusted operating profit from continuing operations decreased by 14% to &pound;144 million. These results were impacted by a &pound;165 million provision for motor finance commission claims and other charges. Despite these challenges, Close Brothers reported an annual profit of &pound;144.3 million, surpassing market expectations. The company attributes this success to effective cost-saving measures and a strategy of selective lending. Chief Executive Mike Morgan stated that the group had taken \"decisive action\" to address these issues. Currently, CBGPY is priced at $13.08, reflecting a change of $0.10, or 0.77%. The stock has seen a high of $15.03 and a low of $4.62 over the past year. The company's market capitalization is approximately $979.06 million. However, the trading volume is notably low, with only 2 shares exchanged on the OTC market.",

        "text": "69Category:ИИCancelКто такой Ларри Эллисон. ИИ-инфраструктура, медиа, цифровой контрольКто такой Ларри Эллисон. ИИ-инфраструктура + медиа + цифровой контрольНедавно американский бизнесмен Ларри Эллисон попал в заголовки мировых СМИ как человек, обогнавший Илона Маска по капиталу (хоть и временно). Всё благодаря сделке по строительству дата-центров в проекте Stargate, о котором мы недавно писали (https://t.me/rybar/73595).А затем фамилия Эллисонов появилась в ряду покупателей приложения TikTok и крупнейших медиа активов в США.Вместе с каналом @Geopolitics_prime (https://t.me/geopolitics_prime/57424) мы разобрались откуда он взялся:Эллисон родился в Нью-Йорке в 1944 году, не закончил университет и долго перебивался случайными работами. Его карьера началась в компании Ampex — подрядчике АНБ, где он участвовал в проекте для ЦРУ под названием Oracle.После провала проекта он вместе с Бобом Майнером и Эдом Оутсом основал Software Development Labs (позднее Oracle). Показательно, что первым клиентом Oracle снова стало ЦРУ, а в 1986 году компания вышла на биржу. Business Insider в 2014 году прямо написал: «Ларри Эллисон — миллиардер благодаря ЦРУ».Федеральные контракты десятилетиями составляли основу бизнеса Oracle. Биограф Эллисона Майк Уилсон даже утверждал: «Oracle не существовала бы без правительственных контрактов». В этом они похожи с Илоном Маском.Сам Эллисон с начала 2000-х активно лоббировал цифровые ID и расширение полномочий спецслужб. Он предлагал создать национальную биометрическую базу США, а позже — оправдывал слежку АНБ, обесценивая разоблачения Сноудена.Сегодня Эллисон — один из главных инвесторов в инфраструктуру искусственного интеллекта. Его Oracle вместе с OpenAI и SoftBank строит сеть дата-центров на $500 млрд по проекту Stargate.Он открыто говорит: граждане будут «вести себя лучше», когда ИИ будет фиксировать каждое их действие. К слову, как раз недавно Великобританию (https://t.me/rybar/73909) сделали полигоном для внедрения цифрового удостоверения личности и переноса всех государственных данных в облако Oracle.Эллисоны не забыли и про медиа активы. Сын миллиардера, Дэвид, через Skydance купил Paramount и готовится объединить CBS и CNN с Warner Bros. Discovery.Сам Ларри фигурирует в числе инвесторов сделки по TikTok в США, а это совпадает с интересами властей в Израиле, которым Эллисон давно жертвует миллионы. TikTok, где либеральная американская молодёжь выражала симпатии Палестине, вскоре окажется под контролем алгоритмов Oracle, в то время как антиизраильские блогеры начали подвергаться жесткой цензуре. (https://t.me/ne_rybar/11171)История Эллисона — далека от классической биографии успешного предпринимателя. Его путь от подрядных проектов ЦРУ до строительства глобальной сети дата-центров, от первых баз данных до цифровых удостоверений личности и покупки крупнейших медиаплатформ показывает, как в руках одного клана складывается новая архитектура контроля.Вычислительные мощности Stargate, базы данных граждан и медиапотоки от CBS до TikTok соединяются в единую систему, где ИИ, безопасность и информационные нарративы обслуживают не абстрактный «прогресс», а интересы американского государства и связанных с ним корпораций. Эллисон — символ того, как спецслужбы и бизнес в США создают техно-олигархию глобального масштаба.Инфографика в высоком разрешении (https://rybar.ru/piwigo/upload/2025/10/02/20251002212716-41384f96.jpg)https://t.me/SunsetEurope/20240- цинкСШАимпериализминтернетискусственный интеллекткорпоратократияDonate to this authorTelegram channel",

Controversies surrounding Wells Fargo's \"Diverse Search Requirement\" policy and its impact on the stock price. Despite challenges, Wells Fargo maintains a strong market position with an \"Outperform\" rating from Evercore ISI and a positive outlook from investors. Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a well-known shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) for long-term stockholders. This follows a class action complaint filed on June 28, 2022, covering a period from February 24, 2021, to June 9, 2022. The focus is on whether Wells Fargo's board breached their fiduciary duties. Wells Fargo, a major player in the banking industry, introduced a \"Diverse Search Requirement\" in 2020. This policy required that at least 50% of interview candidates for certain roles be from underrepresented groups. However, a New York Times article on May 19, 2022, revealed that many interviews were allegedly fake, leading to a 1.04% drop in the stock price, closing at $41.67 on May 20, 2022. Further scrutiny led to Wells Fargo pausing its diverse slate hiring policy, as reported by Reuters on June 6, 2022. CEO Charles Scharf announced a review of these guidelines. On June 9, 2022, the New York Times reported a federal criminal inquiry into the hiring practices, causing an 8.62% decline in the stock price, closing at $38.99 on June 13, 2022. Despite these challenges, Evercore ISI maintained an \"Outperform\" rating for Wells Fargo on September 30, 2025, with the stock priced at $84.65. They also raised the price target from $94 to $98. Currently, WFC is priced at $80.94, with a slight increase of 0.54% today. The stock has fluctuated between $80.44 and $81.69 during the trading day. Wells Fargo's market capitalization is approximately $259.27 billion, with a trading volume of 5,162,424 shares. Over the past year, the stock has seen a high of $86.66 and a low of $55.98. Despite past controversies, the company's stock performance remains strong, reflecting investor confidence in its future prospects.",

(NASDAQ:LPTX) experience declines amidst healthcare trends and clinical trial updates. In recent market movements, several companies have experienced significant price changes, impacting investors and stakeholders. Here's a consolidated analysis of the top losers, focusing on price movements, relevant events, and company developments. Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTNP) sees a dramatic 43.08% drop in its stock price to $13.65. Despite its focus on developing therapeutics for chronic diseases, the decline may be linked to the proposed merger with KE Sdn. Bhd., as highlighted by Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC. The investigation into the merger terms and shareholder ownership could be influencing investor sentiment. American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AREB) experiences a 42.07% decrease in its stock price, now at $10.77. The company, known for safes and personal security products, expands its dealer network through Champion Safe Company, partnering with Guardian Lock & Security.

Specific details about what crypto features it may offer, beyond trading and holding select assets, are not available.A representative for Zerohash declined to comment. The infrastructure firm rumored to be powering OnePay’s crypto initiatives recently announced a $104 million raise led by brokerage firm Interactive Brokers. The raise pushed the firm’s valuation to $1 billion.Initially released to app stores as early as 2020, OnePay’s mobile banking application has shot up the app popularity charts in both Apple and Google Play stores, jumping at least 50 spots in each store over the last month in overall app rankings—now ranked at #58 and #73, respectively. It currently ranks inside the top 5 mobile applications in the finance category in both stores.The app’s potential move into crypto isn’t the first time that Walmart has been connected to the space this year.

        "text": "Economic risks are piling up, and investors are starting to wonder whether shifting their focus to capital preservation is a good idea right now.First, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark federal funds rate by 0.25% in mid-September, with economic sentiment indicating further rate cuts by the end of 2025.Then, a government shutdown went into effect on October 1, meaning federal funds are put on hold for an undetermined amount of time and layoffs from federal government jobs are likely. This has economists and investors anxious, especially as the September employment report from the Department of Laborhas not been released.It’s enough to make anyone question their faith in the economy.We still have ongoing tariff troubles, with the White House signaling new trade taxes this week on items such as timber, lumber, and furniture. All while consumer spending is showing signs of slowing down.That’s why experts are starting to look at defensive stocks to include in their portfolios, to protect some of the profits from this year’s rally in case markets begin to turn.Trading Volatility In A Data VacuumWith the shutdown delaying key economic reports, traders are navigating without their usual playbook. That uncertainty is making every earnings release and corporate guidance update more impactful than usual, sending fresh waves of volatility through the market. On Wednesday, October 8 at 6 PM ET, Benzinga's Chief Market Strategist Matt Maley will reveal how he's adapting to this environment and where he sees the most actionable opportunities for traders right now.Reserve Your Free SpotU.S. heads of household are getting ready to snap their pocketbooks shut, even as the holiday spending season begins in earnest. “Consumer spending is expected to remain relatively strong for the remainder of 2025 before slowing more substantially in 2026,” said Michael Wolf, a global economist with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, in anew research report.“Aggregate wages were growing faster than aggregate spending at the start of the third quarter—a change in trend that could support growth in the coming months. However, employment growth has slowed significantly, which will restrain aggregate wage growth and likely bring spending lower as well.”Here's How To Play Defense When Times (And Moods) Get TightIn an uncertain economic and market environment, investors often shift toward a defensive mode, focusing on ‘safe but not sorry’ sectors like utilities, healthcare, and defense spending (although the latter two may take a sting or two if the federal funding halt persists).“Resilient sectors now are the ones with inelastic demand (people can’t cut it from their budget), pricing power (can pass rising costs through), and with a low refinancing risk (no balance sheet time bombs at 6% rates),” said Carlos Lascurain-Grosvenor, CEO of Grosvenor Square Consulting Group.Lascurain-Grosvenor said his top defensive picks right now are retail, integrated energy, telecom, and healthcare.Oil and gas stocks. For example, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has strong free cash flow, integrated operations, and a reliable dividend. Lascurain-Grosvenor mentioned Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE). “Also, Chevron and TotalEnergies are similar in structure, with decades of consistent dividend increases,” he noted. “TotalEnergies combines oil and gas operations with growing energy transition exposure; yields have been in the 6% range as per some listings.”Retail picks. Lascurain-Grosvenor likes Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) because it has consistently ranked among the top high-yield dividend stocks. “Additionally, Costco is not a value play, but has bulletproof inelastic demand,” he noted.Anti-budget-busting proof picks. Doug Butler, SVP and Director of Research Services at Rockland Trust, recommends stocks that are not impacted when people face tighter personal budgets, including sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and some financial services.Butler recommends three stocks as defensive plays right now, including WEC Energy (NYSE:WEC), calling it “a solid midwestern utility,” Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) “People won't stop brushing their teeth and may even wash their dishes more since they'll be eating out less,” he said, adding Chubb (NYSE:CB) to his list. “Insurance companies tend to be very defensive as almost everyone needs property insurance even during recessions.”Bonds are golden in tough times. Lucas Kiely, CEO of digital asset wealth manager Future Digital, says any selloff in markets would be sector-wide. “So if you’re worried about the economy, I’d hold treasuries because rate cuts are coming,” he advised. “And, in that scenario, treasuries will go higher. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.”Real estate funds with a kick. Segments of the real estate sector have been severely impacted by the banking industry’s withdrawal from traditional lending. “Banks have hundreds of billions of unrealized losses sitting on the books that they have to ride out, rather than fire sale,” said Paul Feinstein, CEO and founder at Audent Global Asset Management. “This gap has created an opportunity for funds in the space to generate strong returns.”Feinstein particularly likes funds that leverage the beneficial tailwinds expected from rate cuts.“We're looking at unique mortgage-backed security plays like AGNC Investment (NASDAQ:AGNC) and Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY),” Feinstein said. “They have substantial dividends (16% and 14%), leverage that will benefit from rate cuts, and mortgage assets that should prove resilient when rate cuts facilitate home transactions for those previously stuck with mortgage interest rates 3-5% below the current market rate.”Editorial content from our expert contributors is intended to be information for the general public and not individualized investment advice.

Analysts pointed to potential benefits from the market&rsquo;s shift to PPA and lease structures under Section 25D, as well as some commercial and industrial share gains, but said execution risks remained. Jefferies estimated SolarEdge&rsquo;s volumes would grow 10% in 2026, well below consensus expectations of 17%. The firm said much of the perceived upside from share gains may already be priced into the stock, and it remained cautious on the residential solar market outlook beyond 2026.",

BAM showcases a strong year-over-year increase in fee-related earnings by 16% and significant capital inflows of $97 billion. Despite a high price-to-distributable earnings (DE) multiple of 38x, BAM's projected annual DE growth of 18% suggests a potential reduction to 16x by 2030. On October 3, 2025, Empire Asset Management adjusted its rating for Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) to Neutral, maintaining a hold action. At this time, BAM's stock price was around $57.35. Bank of America also revised its price target for BAM, lowering it slightly from $68 to $67, as highlighted by TheFly. Brookfield Asset Management is known for its high-growth, asset-light business model. The company is leveraging trends like digital infrastructure, deglobalization, and decarbonization. In Q2, BAM showed strong momentum with a 16% year-over-year increase in fee-related earnings. This growth is supported by significant capital inflows of $97 billion over the past year. Despite a current price-to-distributable earnings (DE) multiple of 38x, BAM's projected annual DE growth of 18% could potentially reduce this multiple to 16x by 2030. This suggests that investors who are patient may see rewards in the long term. The stock's current price on the NYSE is $57.34, reflecting a slight increase of 0.97%. Today, BAM's stock has fluctuated between a low of $56.86 and a high of $57.38. Over the past year, the stock has seen a high of $64.10 and a low of $41.78.

На связи снова Данила Гудынин, DevOps-инженер направления Evolution ML Inference вCloud.ru.В прошлой статье про снижение стоимости инференсамы пробежались по теории того, что и на каких уровнях стека можно подкрутить, чтобы повысить утилизацию своих GPU. Там вы могли определиться, какой подход в принципе подходит для ваших задач.В этой части мы нырнем в практически-технический хар дкор и расскажем, как оптимизировать работу своих графических процессоров с KServe ModelMesh или vLLM Production Stack, подсветим, где разбросаны грабли в этом деле, а еще заглянем под капот к Cloud.ru Shared GPU и объясним, как именно он позволяет нам ставить цены на уровне западных облаков при кратно более дорогом железе в РФ.ML-инженеры, DevOps и MLOps-архитекторы, можете сразу добавлять в закладки, чтобы возвращаться и списывать нужные конфиги. Наливайте бочку чая или чего покрепче, постарался изложить все сугубо по делу, много кода спрятал в «раскрывашки», так что не пугайтесь обозначенного выше времени чтения.Содержание статьиПогружаемся в архитектуру ModelMesh, выясняем что с ней не такПрактический пример развертыванияОграничения и компромиссыvLLM Production Stack: современный подход к инференсуКлючевые компоненты системыДинамическая загрузка LoRA-адаптеровПрактическое развертываниеАвтоскалирование и оркестрацияОграничения и компромиссыЧто под капотом изобретенного нами велосипедаАрхитектура Cloud.ru Shared GPU и в чем суть решенияВ предыдущей частимы с вами выяснили, что существует двастулаподхода к обслуживанию моделей: самурай SMS и ниндзя MMS. Первый живет свою лучшую расточительную жизнь, принося все ресурсы GPU на алтарь своего сюзерена. Второй экономит на жилье, но зато трудолюбивый и не жалеет своих сил на благо нескольких моделек, впрочем, и надежностью не отличается. Также мы выяснили, что ни один из этих воинов нас не устраивает и нужно какое-то гибридное решение. Одним из кандидатов на гибрид стал KServe ModelMesh. Давайте посмотрим внимательнее, что это вообще за зверь такой.Погружаемся в архитектуру ModelMesh, выясняем, что с ней не такModelMesh представляет собой сложную многоуровневую систему, которая радикально меняет подход к обслуживанию моделей. В ее основе лежит интеллектуальный роутер, который берет на себя все решения о том, где и когда запускать модели, освобождая разработчиков от необходимости думать об инфраструктуре.Архитектурно система состоит из трех ключевых слоев:1. Слой роутинга и кеширования.ModelMesh Router работает как диспетчер в аэропорту: анализирует входящие запросы, проверяет состояние кеша и принимает решение о том, на какой inference-сервер направить задачу. Используется распределенный LRU-кеш, который автоматически загружает «горячие» модели в память и выгружает редко используемые. Вытеснение из памяти происходит не просто по принципу «давно не обращались», оно учитывает время, частоту, размер модели и географическую близость для оптимального распределения ресурсов по кластеру. Кроме того, приоритетные модели можно всегда защитить от вытеснения.2. Слой исполнения.Под капотом работают стандартные serving runtime: MLServer, Triton, TorchServe, которые непосредственно обрабатывают запросы к моделям. ModelMesh не изобретает велосипед, а использует проверенные решения, добавляя поверх них слой управления.Пример конфигурации Triton runtimeapiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1\nkind: ServingRuntime\nmetadata:\n  name: triton-runtime\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: triton\n    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:22.12-py3\n    args:\n      - tritonserver\n      - --model-store=/models\n      - --grpc-port=8001\n      - --http-port=8000\n      - --metrics-port=8002\n    resources:\n      limits:\n        cpu: 4\n        memory: 8Gi\n        nvidia.com/gpu: 1\n      requests:\n        cpu: 2\n        memory: 4Gi\n  multiModel: true\n  grpcEndpoint: port:8001\n  supportedModelFormats:\n    - name: tensorflow\n      version: \"2\"\n    - name: pytorch\n      version: \"1\"\n    - name: onnx\n      version: \"1\"3. Слой хранения и интеграции.Storage Puller автоматически загружает модели из различных источников (S3, MinIO, PVC, HTTP), кеширует их локально и управляет очисткой неиспользуемых артефактов.Давайте разберем компоненты детально:ModelMesh Controller— центральный мозг системы— управляет жизненным циклом InferenceService;— принимает решения о размещении моделей;— мониторит состояние всех подов и моделей;— реагирует на изменения в кластере.ModelMesh Serving Pods— рабочие узлы— каждый содержит несколько контейнеров;— могут одновременно обслуживать множество моделей;— автоматически масштабируются в зависимости от нагрузки.Storage Integration— система хранения моделей— поддерживает S3, MinIO, PVC, HTTP;— отвечает за автоматическую загрузку и кеширование моделей;— обеспечивает версионирование и управление артефактами.Анатомия пода Model MeshЗвучит все это прекрасно, здорово и технологично. Так что же не так с этим решением, почему мы его попробовали и отказались?Дело в том, что ModelMesh изначально родился в недрах корпоративного монстра IBM как инструмент для Watson — того самого, который обещал заменить всех аналитиков (спойлер: не заменил). Видя потенциал технологии, IBM приняла стратегическое решение передать ModelMesh под эгиду проекта KServe и сделать его открытым исходным кодом. Шаг был логичный: сообщество получило доступ к обкатанной в продакшне технологии, а IBM могла развивать ее совместно с Kubernetes. Однако при переносе выяснилось: если что-то годами преспокойно работало в корпоративной среде с предсказуемыми нагрузками, совершенно не факт, что оно продолжит это делать в динамической облачной среде. Выяснилось, что инструмент демонстрирует серьезные архитектурные проблемы при:больших нагрузках с тысячами одновременных запросов;большом распределении разных моделей по подам;динамическом масштабировании в cloud-native окружении.А вот, собственно, корень проблемы:Все дороги ведут в etcdКаждый pod постоянно синхронизируется с etcd, что создает:Высокую нагрузку на etcd при большом количестве подов.Задержки в обновлении состояния моделей.Проблемы с консистентностью при частых изменениях.Ограничения масштабируемости системы в целом.В принципе, если вы не коммерческий провайдер, и вам не нужны сверхвысокие SLA, нет жестких требований к изоляции между моделями и модельки размером больше 10 ГБ вы не обрабатываете, решением пользоваться вполне можно. Теперь рассказываем, как.Практический пример развертыванияДавайте рассмотрим полный пример развертывания ModelMesh для обслуживания нескольких моделей:1. Устанавливаем ModelMesh в K8s# Клонируем репозиторий\ngit clone -b release-0.10 https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving.git\ncd modelmesh-serving\n\n# Установка в namespace-scoped режиме\n./scripts/install.sh --namespace modelmesh-serving --namespace-scope-mode --quickstart2.

Создаем шаблон, по которому будет развертываться модель (serving runtime)apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1\nkind: ServingRuntime\nmetadata:\n  name: custom-sklearn-runtime\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: mlserver\n    image: seldonio/mlserver:1.3.2\n    env:\n      - name: MLSERVER_MODELS_DIR\n        value: \"/models\"\n      - name: MLSERVER_LOAD_MODELS_AT_STARTUP\n        value: \"false\"\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        cpu: 500m\n        memory: 1Gi\n  multiModel: true\n  grpcEndpoint: port:8001\n  supportedModelFormats:\n    - name: sklearn\n      version: \"1\"4.

Но ведь теперь надо убедиться, что все работает как надо? К счастью, ModelMesh предоставляет богатые возможности мониторинга через Prometheus-метрики, например:modelmesh_models_loaded_total — количество загруженных моделей;modelmesh_model_loading_duration_seconds — время загрузки моделей;modelmesh_inference_request_duration_seconds — время выполнения инференса;modelmesh_cache_miss_total — количество промахов кеша;modelmesh_memory_usage_bytes — использование памяти.А еще можно сделать Grafana-дашборд{\n  \"dashboard\": {\n    \"title\": \"ModelMesh Performance\",\n    \"panels\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Models per Pod\",\n        \"type\": \"stat\",\n        \"targets\": [\n          {\n            \"expr\": \"sum by (pod) (modelmesh_models_loaded_total)\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Cache Hit Rate\",\n        \"type\": \"stat\",\n        \"targets\": [\n          {\n            \"expr\": \"rate(modelmesh_cache_hit_total[5m]) / rate(modelmesh_inference_requests_total[5m]) * 100\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}Ограничения и компромиссыВ целом ModelMesh нормальный, рабочий инструмент в борьбе за оптимальное использование GPU, с известными оговорками, о которых мы уже упоминали в предыдущей статье. Если избрали этот путь, имейте в виду следующие технические ограничения:Задержки при холодном старте.Первый запрос к модели может быть очень медленным (что не удивительно, если она еще не успела осесть в кеше).Дополнительные затраты памяти.Система управления моделями требует выделения дополнительной памяти для своих внутренних нужд — хранения метаданных, кешей, управления жизненным циклом. Это уменьшает объем памяти, доступный для моделей.Сложность поиска и устранения ошибок.При возникновении проблем очень сложно их локализовать и понять: что-то пошло не так в самой модели, в системе распределения ресурсов или нагрузка на инфраструктуру оказалась несоответствующей? Особенно трудно отследить ошибки, если модели обслуживаются в одном пуле с разными приложениями.Также вас могут поджидать следующие операционные трудности. Заранее подумайте, есть ли у вас в команде человек, который будет этим заниматься на этапе эксплуатации моделей:Настройка кеширования.Для оптимальной работы требуется правильно настроить параметры кеша моделей: объемы памяти, время жизни элементов, стратегии замещения. Это требует квалификации и опыта, поскольку неправильные настройки могут привести к снижению производительности или чрезмерному потреблению ресурсов.Версионирование.Необходимо отслеживать изменения в моделях, чтобы можно было быстро откатить обновление при ошибках, провести A/B-тестирование или анализ. Это включает версионирование веса моделей, конфигураций и данных обучения. При частых обновлениях моделей возникает сложность поддерживать актуальность и согласованность версий.Мультитенантность.Ограниченная изоляция между клиентами приводит к ситуации, когда проблемы одного пользователя могут повлиять на работу другого, например из-за общих ресурсов памяти или вычислительных блоков. Это создает риски для безопасности и стабильности работы в условиях многоклиентского использования.vLLM Production Stack: современный подход к инференсуЕсли ModelMesh управляет всем циклом жизни запускаемых моделей централизованно, организуя все и решая, где исполнять, то vLLM Production Stack действует иначе. Он работает как распределитель запросов, который находится перед группой vLLM-инстансов, а логика планирования при этом у каждого экземпляра vLLM остается своя. В российском сегменте интернета про vLLM написано маловато, поэтому постараемся исправить эту досадную несправедливость.Архитектура vLLM Production StackКлючевые компоненты системыЦентральный компонент системы — Request Router, который работает как интеллектуальный шлюз перед vLLM инстансами. Его основные функции:1. Алгоритмы маршрутизации:Round-Robin— циклическое распределение запросовSession-ID based— маршрутизация по идентификатору сессииPrefix-aware— учет префиксов для максимизации KV-кешаKV cache-aware— интеллектуальная маршрутизация на основе состояния кеша2. Хеширование для балансировки нагрузки:# Пример алгоритма хеширования для session-based routing\ndef get_target_instance(session_id: str, available_instances: List[str]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Консистентное хеширование для определения целевого инстанса\n    \"\"\"\n    hash_value = hashlib.md5(session_id.encode()).hexdigest()\n    instance_index = int(hash_value, 16) % len(available_instances)\n    return available_instances[instance_index]3. Service Discovery:автоматическое обнаружение vLLM подов через Kubernetes API,health checking и автоматическое исключение неработающих инстансов,dynamic backend registration.Пример конфигурации роутера:apiVersion: production-stack.vllm.ai/v1alpha1\nkind: StaticRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: llama-routing\nspec:\n  serviceDiscovery: kubernetes\n  routingLogic: prefix-aware\n  backends:\n    - service: vllm-llama-service-1\n      weight: 100\n    - service: vllm-llama-service-2  \n      weight: 100\n  healthCheck:\n    enabled: true\n    interval: 30s\n    timeout: 5sServing Engine с оптимизацией vLLMПоскольку в vLLM Production Stack у каждого инстанса есть возможность работать со своим нативным шедулером, это дает нам несколько важных преимуществ:полная совместимость с upstream vLLM,все оптимизации vLLM работают без изменений,сontinuous batching остается эффективным,поддержка всех vLLM-фич (Speculative Decoding, Multi-LoRA и т.д.).servingEngineSpec:\n  modelSpec:\n  - name: \"llama-3-70b\"\n    repository: \"vllm/vllm-openai\"\n    tag: \"v0.4.0\"\n    modelURL: \"meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf\"\n    \n    # Включаем LoRA поддержку\n    enableLoRA: true\n    maxLoraRank: 16\n    \n    # vLLM специфичные настройки\n    vllmConfig:\n      tensorParallelSize: 4\n      maxModelLen: 4096  \n      enforceEager: false\n      gpuMemoryUtilization: 0.9\n      enableChunkedPrefill: true\n      \n    # Kubernetes resources\n    replicaCount: 2\n    requestGPU: 4\n    requestMemory: \"200Gi\"Чтобы наблюдать за производительностью, у vLLM есть встроенная система мониторинга, поэтому с помощью Prometheus можно отследить любые метрики, например:vllm_request_duration_seconds — время обработки запросов;vllm_time_to_first_token_seconds — TTFT-метрики;vllm_cache_hit_rate — эффективность KV кеша;vllm_memory_usage_bytes — использование GPU-памяти;router_request_count_total — количество запросов через роутер.Для полного счастья и прозрачности создаем Grafana-дашборд:{\n  \"dashboard\": {\n    \"title\": \"vLLM Production Stack\",\n    \"panels\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Request Latency P95\",\n        \"targets\": [{\n          \"expr\": \"histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(vllm_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))\"\n        }]\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Cache Hit Rate\",\n        \"targets\": [{\n          \"expr\": \"rate(vllm_cache_hit_total[5m]) / rate(vllm_inference_requests_total[5m]) * 100\"\n        }]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}Под капотом у Request RouterТеперь, когда нам более-менее понятна вся цепочка процессов в vLLM, вернемся к ключевому компоненту — Request Router и посмотрим, как он анализирует поступающие запросы, принимает решения о том, на какой из инстансов направить запросы и динамически управляет дополнительными LoRA-адаптерами для персонализации и оптимизации моделей без перезагрузки сервисов. Если интересно, разворачивайте, если нет — скачем дальше.1. Round-Robin роутингRound-Robin помогает быстро и просто равномерно делить нагрузку без сложных вычислений. Этот метод последовательно отправляет каждый новый запрос на следующий сервер из списка, циклично. Примерно как крупье, раздающий по очереди карты всем участникам игры. Такой подход прост и обеспечивает равномерное распределение нагрузки при условии, что все серверы примерно одинаковы по мощности.class RoundRobinRouter:\n    def __init__(self, backends: List[str]):\n        self.backends = backends\n        self.current_index = 0\n        \n    def get_next_backend(self) -> str:\n        backend = self.backends[self.current_index]\n        self.current_index = (self.current_index + 1) % len(self.backends)\n        return backend2. Session-ID роутингЭтот метод гарантирует, что все запросы от одного пользователя или сессии попадут на один и тот же сервер. Это важно для улучшения производительности, потому что сервер сохраняет состояние или кеш, что ускоряет обработку последующих запросов. Важно, чтобы пользователь не «прыгал» между разными серверами, что могло бы ухудшить качество работы.class SessionRouter:\n    def route_request(self, request: Request) -> str:\n        session_id = request.headers.get('session-id', \n                                       request.headers.get('x-session-id'))\n        if session_id:\n            return self.get_target_instance(session_id, self.backends)\n        return self.fallback_router.route(request)3. Prefix-aware роутингПредставьте, что у вас есть список экспертов (серверов) и вопросы, которые им адресуют. Вы получаете вопрос из зала «С каким счетом Бразилия выиграла у Германии на ЧМ по футболу в 2014 году?». Логично будет, направить этот вопрос Саньку, который уже отвечал вам на околофутбольные запросы, а не Марине, которая отвечала вам, кто такой Серкан Болат и в чью дверь он стучится. Здесь суть та же: система анализирует префиксы входящих запросов и направляет их на инстансы, где уже есть похожие префиксы в KV-кеше.Пример конфигурации Kubernetes для prefix-aware роутинга:apiVersion: production-stack.vllm.ai/v1alpha1\nkind: Router\nmetadata:\n  name: prefix-aware-router\nspec:\n  routingStrategy: prefix-aware\n  prefixConfig:\n    minPrefixLength: 10\n    maxPrefixLength: 512\n    similarityThreshold: 0.8\n    cacheStateUpdateInterval: 1sАлгоритм вычисления наилучшего совпадения по префиксам:def find_best_instance_for_prefix(prefix: str, instances: List[Instance]) -> Instance:\n    best_match = None\n    best_score = 0.0\n    \n    for instance in instances:\n        # Получаем состояние KV кеша инстанса\n        cache_prefixes = instance.get_cached_prefixes()\n        \n        for cached_prefix in cache_prefixes:\n            similarity = calculate_prefix_similarity(prefix, cached_prefix)\n            if similarity > best_score and similarity > self.similarity_threshold:\n                best_score = similarity\n                best_match = instance\n                \n    return best_match or self.fallback_instance()4. KV cache-aware роутингПри использовании этого метода система отслеживает состояние KV-кеша каждого инстанса, производит оценку «выгоды» от направления запроса в тот или иной инстанс на основе метрик кеша и текущей загрузки и отправляет запрос туда, где эффективность переиспользования кеша максимальна.Как выполняется мониторинг состояния кеша каждого инстанса:class KVCacheMonitor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.cache_states = {}\n        \n    async def update_cache_state(self, instance_id: str):\n        \"\"\"Получаем состояние KV кеша от vLLM инстанса\"\"\"\n        response = await self.get_cache_metrics(instance_id)\n        self.cache_states[instance_id] = {\n            'hit_rate': response['cache_hit_rate'],\n            'utilization': response['cache_utilization'],\n            'active_sequences': response['active_sequences'],\n            'prefixes': response['cached_prefixes']\n        }А вот так выстраивается логика маршрутизации с учетом состояния кеша:def route_with_cache_awareness(self, request: Request) -> str:\n    request_prefix = self.extract_prefix(request.prompt)\n    \n    # Ищем инстанс с максимальным потенциалом переиспользования кеша\n    best_instance = None\n    best_score = 0.0\n    \n    for instance_id, cache_state in self.cache_states.items():\n        score = self.calculate_cache_reuse_score(\n            request_prefix, \n            cache_state['prefixes'],\n            cache_state['utilization']\n        )\n        \n        if score > best_score:\n            best_score = score\n            best_instance = instance_id\n            \n    return best_instance or self.get_least_loaded_instance()Динамическая загрузка LoRA-адаптеровОдна из самых крутых функций vLLM Production Stack — возможность динамически загружать и выгружать LoRA-адаптеры без перезапуска подов. Если вы, конечно, старовер и еще используете LoRA-адаптеры (мы не осуждаем).Поработаю немножко кэпом и расскажу, почему это важно. LoRA — это небольшая надстройка, которая добавляется к большой предварительно обученной модели и меняет ее поведение, не перекраивая всю модель. Адаптеры модульны, поэтому каждым из них можно управлять отдельно и хранить несколько для разных задач в файловой системе или хранилище данных. Если «включать» и «выключать» нужные адаптеры мы получаем:бесперебойный инференс и доступ к большой модели без даунтайма;эффективное использование ресурсов, ведь загружаются только те адаптеры, которые нужны, а остальные не давят на GPU и экономят память;модели можно кастомизировать под конкретные задачи прямо на лету без перебоев в работе всей системы;вместо того чтобы держать у себя 2 больших версии модели, можно держать одну и переключаться между разными адаптерами для A/B-тестирования, что опять-таки экономит ресурсы.В общем, это нам надо, берем.

Основных оператора, которые могут быть полезны в задачах оптимизации инференса три:vLLM Operator. Автоматизирует развёртывание подов vLLM, следит за их состоянием, выполняет обновления без остановок (rollouts) и оптимизирует расход ресурсов на основе метрик.Router Operator.Управляет динамическим обновлением маршрутов запросов, обнаруживает новые backend-сервисы (service discovery), обеспечивает проверку здоровья компонентов (health checking) и защиту от сбоев (circuit breaking), а также настраивает балансировку нагрузки (load balancing).LoRA Operator.Автоматизирует загрузку и выгрузку LoRA адаптеров, отвечает за управление их жизненным циклом, поддерживает A/B тестирование различных конфигураций и мониторит производительность адаптеров, а также их масштабирование.Практическое развертываниеСценарий для минимальной конфигурацииШаг 1: Устанавливаем vLLM Production Stack в K8s# Добавляем Helm репозиторий\nhelm repo add vllm https://vllm-project.github.io/production-stack\nhelm repo update\n\n# Устанавливаем с минимальной конфигурацией\nhelm install vllm-stack vllm/vllm-stack -f values-minimal.yamlvalues-minimal.yaml:servingEngineSpec:\n  modelSpec:\n  - name: \"opt125m\"\n    repository: \"vllm/vllm-openai\"\n    tag: \"latest\"\n    modelURL: \"facebook/opt-125m\"\n    \n    replicaCount: 2\n    \n    requestCPU: 2\n    requestMemory: \"8Gi\"\n    requestGPU: 0.5\n    \n    vllmConfig:\n      maxModelLen: 2048\n      gpuMemoryUtilization: 0.8\n      \nrouter:\n  enabled: true\n  strategy: \"round-robin\"\n  \nobservability:\n  prometheus:\n    enabled: true\n  grafana:\n    enabled: trueШаг 2: Проверяем развертывание# Проверяем статус подов\nkubectl get pods -l app=vllm-stack\n\n# Проверяем роутер\nkubectl port-forward svc/vllm-router-service 8080:80\n\n# Тестируем API\ncurl http://localhost:8080/v1/modelsСценарий для развертывания нескольких моделейservingEngineSpec:\n  modelSpec:\n  # Модель для общих задач\n  - name: \"llama-3-8b\"\n    modelURL: \"meta-llama/Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"\n    replicaCount: 3\n    requestGPU: 1\n    \n  # Модель для кода\n  - name: \"codellama-7b\"  \n    modelURL: \"codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf\"\n    replicaCount: 2\n    requestGPU: 1\n    \n  # Модель для embeddings\n  - name: \"bge-large\"\n    modelURL: \"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\"\n    replicaCount: 4\n    requestGPU: 0.5\n\nrouter:\n  strategy: \"intelligent\"\n  rules:\n  - matcher:\n      promptPattern: \".*code.*|.*programming.*|.*function.*\"\n    target:\n      model: \"codellama-7b\"\n  - matcher:\n      requestType: \"embedding\"\n    target:\n      model: \"bge-large\"\n  - matcher:\n      default: true\n    target:\n      model: \"llama-3-8b\"Автоскалирование и оркестрацияГоризонтальное масштабированиеapiVersion: autoscaling/v2\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: vllm-hpa\nspec:\n  scaleTargetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: vllm-llama-deployment\n  minReplicas: 2\n  maxReplicas: 10\n  metrics:\n  - type: Pods\n    pods:\n      metric:\n        name: vllm_queue_depth\n      target:\n        type: AverageValue\n        averageValue: \"5\"\n  - type: Pods\n    pods:\n      metric:\n        name: vllm_gpu_utilization\n      target:\n        type: AverageValue\n        averageValue: \"80\"\nbehavior:\n  scaleUp:\n    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60\n    policies:\n    - type: Percent\n      value: 50\n      periodSeconds: 60\n  scaleDown:\n    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300\n    policies:\n    - type: Percent\n      value: 25\n      periodSeconds: 60Вертикальное автомасштабированиеapiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1\nkind: VerticalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: vllm-vpa\nspec:\n  targetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: vllm-llama-deployment\n  updatePolicy:\n    updateMode: \"Auto\"\n  resourcePolicy:\n    containerPolicies:\n    - containerName: vllm\n      maxAllowed:\n        memory: 400Gi\n        nvidia.com/gpu: 8\n      minAllowed:\n        memory: 50Gi\n        nvidia.com/gpu: 1Ограничения и компромиссыОщущения от работы с vLLM Production Stack смешанные. Набор встроенных возможностей, конечно, впечатляет: интеллектуальная маршрутизация, поддержка динамической загрузки LoRA-адаптеров и глубокая интеграция с Kubernetes дают все козыри на руки, если ваша задача инференсить большие языковые модели. Автоматизация через операторы опять-таки облегчает жизнь. Но есть много «но», из-за которых мы работать с этой технологией не стали:Заточка под LLM.Решение полностью ориентировано на большие языковые модели. Можно, конечно, с небольшими оговорками прикрутить интеграцию с других ML-моделек, но нам принципиально хотелось более универсального решения.Необходимость выбирать между гибкостью и изоляцией.Использование общего кэша и динамическая маршрутизация упрощают масштабирование, но снижают степень изоляции между клиентами и моделями, что может быть критично для задач с повышенными требованиями к безопасности и SLA.Задержки и overhead.Первый запрос к модели может обрабатываться медленнее, так как модель и необходимые данные загружаются в память только при первом обращении. Это особенно заметно при динамической загрузке LoRA адаптеров. Дополнительные затраты CPU, памяти и сети для управления всем этим великолепием иногда становятся просто раздражающими.Сложность настройки и сопровождения.Если у вас небольшой штат, то коммерческая польза от оптимизации GPU может быть сведена к минимуму из-за того, что требуются редкие квалифицированные спецы, которые смогут настроить оптимальные параметры кеширования, маршрутизации, автомасштабирования и вовремя реагировать на сбои и аномалии. Да, использование Kubernetes Operator сокращает ручной труд, но требует времени и ресурсов на разработку и поддержку операторов.Что под капотом изобретенного нами велосипедаЦеленаправленно поискав «грабли» в готовых решениях, мы поняли, что ни одно из них нам не подходит. Задержки при первом старте в ModelMesh были просто катастрофическими. Реальный тест на наших данных показал 8+ секунд! Чтобы вы понимали, в B2B порог неприемлемого начинается уже после 2 секунд. vLLM Production Stack сильно ограничен по области применения. Мы протестировали совместимость технологии с другими типами моделей (а вдруг?), но результат оказался неутешительным:test_results:\n  llm_models: ✅  # Llama, GPT работают отлично\n  embedding_models: ❌  # BGE, Sentence-BERT не поддерживаются\n  classification_models: ❌  # BERT-based классификаторы проблематичны\n  computer_vision: ❌  # ResNet, YOLO вообще не работают\n  custom_models: ❌  # Собственные архитектуры невозможныНаша реальность такова и больше никаковаАнализ реальных паттернов использования показал, что для большинства задач не нужна вся сложность мультимодельного подхода обслуживания, но обязательна эффективность использования GPU. Так мы пришли к выводу, что подход к обслуживанию моделей нам менять не надо, надо решить проблему на уровне виртуализации GPU.Архитектура Cloud.ru Shared GPU и в чем суть решенияCloud.ru Shared GPU состоит из двух основных компонентов.1. cloudru-vgpu-plugin— компонент DaemonSet:развертывание происходит на каждом GPU-узле,инжектирует перехватчик vGPU в контейнеры,управляет жизненным циклом .so библиотеки,обеспечивает изоляцию процессов.2. cloudru-vgpu-scheduler— центральный планировщик:представляет физический графический процессор как кластер ресурсов.выполняет интеллектуальные обязанности.мониторит использование и производительность.принимает решения по размещению рабочей нагрузки.А теперь самая главная идея. Вместо изменения ML-фреймворков мы перехватываем вызовы CUDA на уровне библиотек и виртуализируем память GPU. Для этого мы ставим между подами и GPU наш интерцептор.Поясняю, все обращения к GPU идут через две библиотеки:libcuda.so.1 — основные CUDA операции.libnvml.so.1 — управление GPU (память, мониторинг).Мы используем middleware-версии этих библиотек, которые:Получают запрос от приложения: «Дай мне информацию о GPU».Подменяют ответ: вместо «У тебя 80 ГБ памяти» отвечают «У тебя 10 ГБ памяти».Контролируют выделение: если приложение просит больше 10 ГБ — блокируют запрос.Передают разрешенные операции настоящим NVIDIA-библиотекам.Результат: каждое приложение «видит» персональную GPU нужного размера, хотя на самом деле все работают на одной физической карте. Приложению не нужно знать, что оно в «виртуальной» среде — для него все выглядит как обычная работа с GPU.В итоге мы получаем:Универсальность.Решение работает слюбымML-фреймворком (vLLM, Triton, TensorFlow, PyTorch), не боится проприетарного ПО, не требует обновлений от      разработчиков фреймворков.Прозрачность.Приложение «думает», что у него персональная GPU, при этом      никаких изменений в коде приложения не требуется, а мониторинг доступен с      помощью стандартных инструментов.Изоляцию.Если приложение просит больше памяти — получает ошибку, но не крашит других, а каждый контейнер видит свою виртуальную GPU.Теперь поговорим о технической реализации.cloudru-vgpu-plugin: инженерный перехватчикcloudru-vgpu-plugin развертывается как DaemonSet на каждом GPU-узле и выполняет ключевые функции:1.

Утилизация GPU выросла с 23% до 78% (+339%), задержка увеличилась всего на 7% (подробные таблицы до/после можно посмотреть в предыдущей статье), зато отладка стала в пять раз быстрее. Затраты на GPU-инфраструктуру снизились на 67%, задержки держатся в допустимых пределах с коэффициентом вариации <12%. Спустя восемь месяцев после внедрения  система управляет 247 моделями на 52 GPU-узлах, и за это время у нас было всего три инцидента.Помимо отличных результатов, изобретение собственного Shared GPU принесло нам несколько важных уроков:Урок 1: Чем проще — тем лучшеПопытки создать сложные системы управления моделями (вроде ModelMesh) часто создают больше проблем, чем решают. Зато старый добрый инженерный принцип KISS (keep it simple, stupid) работает безотказно.Урок 2: Мониторинг — это база, а не опцияБез подробной статистики и метрик для каждого процесса невозможно эффективно управлять GPU. Нужно собирать данные о производительности с самого начала работы системы, а не добавлять мониторинг потом как дополнение.Урок 3: Система должна быть универсальнойML-мир меняется очень быстро — каждые полгода появляются новые фреймворки и подходы. Поэтому система виртуализации GPU должна работать с любыми инструментами, а не привязываться к конкретному фреймворку, который может быстро устареть.Урок 4: Удобство разработчиков решает всеЕсли система неудобна для DS-инженеров и они тратят много времени на отладку и диагностику проблем, то они найдут способы обойти эту систему. Важно делать инструменты максимально дружелюбными для тех, кто их использует каждый день.Вот, кажется, и все. Эй, кто осилил эту простыню вместе с «раскрывашками», вы там живы? Понимаю, объем негуманный, но уж лучше все сразу и в одном месте. Расскажите в комментах, что пробовали, чтобы выжать максимум из своих GPU, но так, чтобы они не надорвались, и какие у вас впечатления от этих решений?Теги:vgpumodelmeshvllm-production-stackХабы:Блог компании Cloud.ruIT-инфраструктураОблачные сервисыИскусственный интеллектМашинное обучение",

КаксообщаетBusiness Insider, ссылаясь на свидетельства украинских военных, для ликвидации позиций операторов применяются ракеты и бомбы.В связи с возросшей ролью БПЛА на поле боя, операторы дронов стали приоритетной целью для ВС РФ. По оценкам, до 70% потерь связаны с использованием дронов. Офицер ВСУ в разговоре с изданием констатирует увеличение числа погибших операторов: если раньше такие случаи были единичными, то сейчас они участились, что привело к значительному росту смертности.По словам одного из украинских пилотов, ВС РФ готовы к массированным атакам с использованием дорогостоящего вооружения, как только обнаруживают оператора дрона. Это означает, что даже небольшое количество операторов может стать целью для мощных ударов. В свою очередь, украинские операторы дронов вынуждены адаптироваться, используя тактику ухода вглубь земли, частой смены позиций и создания маскировочных укрытий.9 из 10 бьют в цель: Российские дроны научили обманывать РЭБ ВСУРанее сообщалось, чтоэффективность ударов БПЛА «Герань-2» после модернизации увеличилась на 30%.Всё благодаря увеличению массы боевой части.Главные сводки, заявления и события —в разделе «СВО» на Life.ru.Наталья Демьянова",

The Los Azules project, a significant venture for McEwen Mining, receives a boost with its inclusion in Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI). Current stock price of MUX is $16.42, with a market capitalization of approximately $888.43 million. McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE:MUX) is a mining company focused on precious metals, primarily gold and silver, with operations in the Americas. The company is known for its significant projects, including the Los Azules copper project in Argentina. MUX competes with other mining companies like Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation in the precious metals sector. On October 3, 2025, Joe Reagor from Roth Capital set a price target of $19 for MUX. At that time, MUX was priced at $16.42, suggesting a potential increase of about 15.71%. This optimistic outlook comes amid developments in the Los Azules project, which is part of McEwen Copper, a subsidiary of McEwen Mining. The Los Azules project in San Juan, Argentina, is a significant venture for McEwen Mining. TNR Gold Corp, which holds a 0.4% net smelter returns royalty on this project, announced its inclusion in Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI). This policy aims to boost strategic initiatives, with an investment of $2.672 billion for exploration, construction, and operations. Rob McEwen, chairman of McEwen Mining, highlighted the importance of the RIGI, emphasizing Argentina's support for long-term projects in energy and critical metals. This development could enhance investor confidence in MUX, aligning with the positive price target set by Roth Capital. Currently, MUX is priced at $16.42, reflecting a decrease of 2.15% or $0.36.

Об этомпишетBusiness Insider (BI) со ссылкой на украинских военных.«Россия все чаще преследует украинских пилотов беспилотников, поскольку считает их серьезной угрозой», — предположили журналисты.Как заявили BI несколько украинских операторов БПЛА, число потерь их сослуживцев в последнее время увеличилось из-за использования против них тяжелого вооруженияВС России. Один из бойцов ВСУ предположил, что российские войска используют все возможные виды оружия против находящихся в зоне поражения дроноводов.Издание подчеркивает, что взаимная охота российских и украинских военных на операторов БПЛА подчеркивает их роль в современном конфликте. По оценкам BI, на беспилотники приходится порядка 70 процентов поражения целей на фронте.Ранее командир наемников Грузинского национального легиона в составе ВСУМамука Мамулашвилив комментарии The Wall Street Journalпохвалилсотрудников российского центра «Рубикон».

        "text": "Joey Agree, President & CEO of Agree Realty Corporation (NYSE:ADC), has increased his stake in the company, signaling confidence in its future. ADC is poised to announce its Q3 2025 operating results, which are highly anticipated by investors to gauge the company's financial health and performance. The company's financial metrics, including a P/E ratio of 41.14 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58, offer insights into its market valuation and financial stability. Agree Realty Corporation (NYSE:ADC), a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in acquiring and developing properties net leased to industry-leading retail tenants, has recently made headlines. On October 2, 2025, Joey Agree, the President & CEO of ADC, purchased 3,528 shares of the company's common stock at $70.63 per share. This strategic acquisition increased his total ownership to 638,688 shares, as detailed in a Form 4 filing with the SEC. Looking ahead, ADC is set to release its third-quarter 2025 operating results on October 21, 2025. The company will hold a conference call the following day to discuss these results, providing a vital opportunity for investors to assess the company's financial health and performance. This announcement, as reported by Business Wire, is crucial for stakeholders to understand ADC's current market position and future growth prospects. ADC's financial metrics shed light on its valuation and market position. The company boasts a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41.14 and a price-to-sales ratio of 11.86, indicating high investor expectations for future growth. Additionally, the enterprise value to sales ratio of 16.85 and the enterprise value to operating cash flow ratio of 23.25 further highlight ADC's valuation in relation to its sales and cash generation capabilities. The earnings yield of 2.43% offers another perspective on the company's earnings relative to its stock price. With a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58, ADC demonstrates a moderate level of debt, suggesting a balanced approach to financing. However, the current ratio of 0.22 raises concerns about the company's ability to meet short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. Investors and analysts will be keenly watching how these metrics evolve in the upcoming earnings release, looking for signs of financial stability and growth potential.",

        "text": "Warren Buffett gets a lot of attention due to his remarkable track record running Berkshire Hathaway over the past several decades. There is no shortage of investors who try to emulate his style of value investing, a strategy that has worked extremely well.However, that's not the only way investors can allocate capital. Buying companies that are growing revenues and/or earnings quickly can also work out very well. What's more, many people might find this philosophy to be more interesting.With that being said, here's the ultimategrowth stockto buy with $1,000 right now.Online shopping is still importantIf investors are looking to add more growth potential to their portfolios, it's worth considering making an investment in Amazon (AMZN-1.34%). While the company isn't expanding quite as rapidly as it was in the early days (net sales skyrocketed an astonishing 841% in 1997), this is a top choice due to the durability of its growth. Yes, there are smaller companies in various industries that might be more exciting, but they certainly aren't as proven as Amazon.Amazon still gives investors plenty of reasons to be optimistic. The business has its hands in multiple industries that have tremendous growth potential over the long term.The Amazon empire began as an online marketplace that only sold books. Today, it sells virtually everything under the Sun. Shoppers can even buy cars on the website. Perhaps amazon.com, which had a whopping 2.7 billion visitors in August, could become a major player in residential real estate in the future.In the U.S., less than 20% of theretail sectoris represented by online shopping, which provides a big runway for growth. As the leader in the industry, Amazon will benefit.Exciting areas for investors to focus onThe most exciting area for investors, though, has to be the cloud-computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This has been a key growth driver in the past decade, a trend that continues to be true. Revenue was up 17% in the second quarter (ended June 30). Given that CEO Andy Jassy estimates that more than 85% of all IT spending still hasn't migrated to the cloud, there is a big opportunity as the transition continues.There is competition in the space, most notably from Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. The pie will be big enough for many winners, as Grand View Research estimates the industry will be worth $2.4 trillion by the end of this decade. And with businesses in every industry looking toleverage artificial intelligence(AI), cloud-computing platforms that provide necessary capabilities like AWS will become mission-critical partners.Investors should also pay attention to digital advertising, a thriving segment that collected $15.7 billion in revenue during Q2, a 22% year-over-year increase. Amazon has valuable digital real estate, both on its online marketplace and on Prime Video, that it is monetizing. Only Alphabet and Meta Platforms have larger digital ad efforts.Those two internet giants register wideoperating margins. While Amazon doesn't report how profitable its digital advertising segment is, investors can safely assume it's an extremely lucrative division.Buying a dominant companyBuying good growth companies can result in wonderful returns forlong-term investors. I believe this will be true of Amazon over the next five years.As mentioned, the company is clearly well positioned to benefit from multiple secular trends, which will provide a lift to revenue. And this should support higher earnings over time, particularly as more sales come from higher-margin segments.Amazon has a fantastic history of success. There is no reason to believe this will change, as it remains a dominant business. It's the ultimate growth stock to buy with $1,000 right now.",

        "text": "Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) has seen a monthly gain of 10.34%, indicating strong investor interest and positive market sentiment. The company's stock has a projected growth potential of 8.47%, supported by favorable market dynamics and strategic positioning in the uranium sector. Cameco's financial health is robust, with a Piotroski Score of 8, reflecting strong fundamentals and efficient management practices. Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is a prominent player in the uranium industry, known for its extensive operations in mining, refining, and producing uranium fuel. The company is headquartered in Saskatoon, Canada, and is one of the largest uranium producers globally. Cameco's main competitors include companies like Kazatomprom and Orano, which also operate in the uranium sector. Cameco's recent performance has been impressive, with a monthly gain of approximately 10.34%. This increase reflects strong investor interest and positive market sentiment towards the company. However, in the last 10 days, the stock has experienced a slight decline of about 2.30%. This short-term dip might present a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the company's long-term potential. The growth potential for CCJ is significant, with an estimated stock price growth potential of 8.47%. This suggests that the stock is likely to appreciate further, supported by favorable market dynamics and Cameco's strategic positioning in the uranium sector. The company's focus on operational efficiency and strategic initiatives enhances its prospects for growth. Cameco's financial health is robust, as indicated by its Piotroski Score of 8. This score reflects strong fundamentals and efficient management practices, suggesting that the company is financially sound. The Piotroski Score is a tool used to assess a company's financial strength, and a score of 8 is considered high, indicating a well-managed company. Analysts have set a target price of $91.33 for CCJ, which indicates substantial upside potential from its current levels. This target price reflects confidence in Cameco's future performance and its strong market position. As a leading player in the uranium industry, Cameco is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for nuclear energy, further supporting its growth prospects.",

        "text": "projectgeekвчера в 10:55Какие CRM самые лучшие? Отвечаю на 24 острых вопроса о CRM-системахУровень сложностиПростойВремя на прочтение11 минКоличество просмотров969Блог компании YouGileУправление продажами*Управление проектами*Управление персоналом*CRM-системы*FAQКажется, про CRM написано уже немало, но вопросы всё равно остаются. Поэтому решил объяснить и я — максимально просто и наглядно.Сразу предупреждаю: в некоторых ответах я привожу в пример бесплатную CRM YouGile. Но на все вопросы о CRM отвечаю чётко и честно ― проверьте сами.Нужна ли CRM и что это такое1. Что вообще такое CRM и зачем она мне?Давайте на примере. Представьте менеджера Анатолия. Он работает в строительной компании и каждый день ведет переговоры с клиентами. У него много объектов, среди которых ремонт офиса на Тверской, отделка кафе на Арбате и перепланировка квартиры в Новой Москве.Типичный понедельник Анатолия без CRM — это:10:00 — владелец кафе просит смету, потому что она затерялась в общем чате.14:00 — собственник квартиры возмущается, потому что ему не перезвонили по дизайн-проекту.17:00 — руководитель требует отчёт по всем объектам, а данные разбросаны по Excel и блокноту.Если бы у Анатолия была CRM, она бы напомнила ему о звонке, собрала отчёт и нашла смету.CRM — это цифровая память вашего бизнеса. Вместо хаоса из Excel, блокнота и чатов — одна система, где видны все клиенты, этапы сделок и пробуксовки.2. Я веду клиентов просто в Excel — зачем мне CRM?Excel — это просто электронный блокнот. Если у вас не больше десяти клиентов, он поможет сохранить их номера телефонов и важные заметки. Но когда клиентов хотя бы несколько десятков, вы тратите время на поиск данных, путаетесь в версиях файлов и пропускаете важные звонки. Если бы у менеджера Анатолия была CRM, он не забыл бы перезвонить клиенту по дизайн-проекту, потому что система напомнит.Excel лишь хранит данные. CRM — помогает заработать деньги.3. Нас всего 3 человека — нам точно нужна CRM?Представьте магазин цветов «Тюльпан». В нем работает три флориста, которые принимают заказы на букеты в мессенджере. Но девушки не были готовы к наплыву заказов на 8 марта и в хаосе сообщений потеряли половину заявок. Как объяснить это рассерженным клиентам, которые не смогли подарить букеты женщинам?А если бы в магазине была CRM, все заявки сохранились бы и их можно было бы быстро отсортировать по статусу или срочности.Владелец «Тюльпана» все равно придет к CRM, когда флористов станет четверо. Но в итоге он потеряет клиентов и потратит вдвое больше времени на перенос данных из чатов.4. CRM — это только для продаж или ещё для чего-то?CRM — как швейцарский нож для увеличения прибыли компании. Продажи — это главное лезвие, но не единственное.Представьте сервисный центр, который занимается ремонтом техники. Владелец научен горьким опытом, поэтому сразу установил CRM, которая:Автоматически напоминает клиентам о ТО, а они оставляют благодарные отзывы.Ведет историю ремонтов, чтобы мастер не спрашивал: «А что у вас там сгорело в прошлый раз?».Контролирует работу мастеров без звонков «Где вы и когда доставите мой холодильник?».CRM — это польза для всей компании. Она нужна маркетологу, бухгалтеру, логистам и менеджерам.Внедрение CRM5. Как выбрать CRM?Отнеситесь к выбору CRM как к покупке квартиры ― сначала решите, что вам от нее нужно. Это будет семейное гнездышко или инвестиционный объект, а сдавать вы хотите на долгосрок или посуточно туристам?Так и в бизнесе.Интернет-магазину нужна CRM с интеграцией маркетплейсов и телефонией. Проектным отделам полезны канбан-доски и контроль сроков. А если ваша боль — потерянные заявки, ищите систему с чат-ботами и автоматизацией.CRM можно условно разделить на два типа — простые и сложные.Простые подходят для малого бизнеса:их легко запустить, не нужно тратить недели на внедрение, и они помогают держать процессы под контролем без лишних функций. К таким системам относитсяYouGile. Это универсальная CRM для небольшой команды — скорее 1–2 менеджера, чем большой отдел продаж. Собрать первую воронку и настроить доступы можно максимум за полчаса, даже если вы и ваши сотрудники ещё не пользовались CRM.Сложные CRM подойдут корпорациям и большим отделам продаж.Их ценят за широкие возможности: глубокую аналитику, гибкую настройку воронок и процессов, интеграцию с другими корпоративными системами. Такие решения обычно внедряют через интеграторов, зато потом они позволяют строить продажи под любые бизнес-сценарии. Среди популярных систем этого уровня — Bitrix24 и amoCRM.Если вам интересно, я выпускал несколько обзоров CRM, которые помогут определиться с выбором. Например, вот мойпоследний обзорхороших российских сервисов.6. CRM для малого бизнеса и для корпорации ― они разные? Какая нужна мне?Разница между CRM для малого бизнеса и корпоративной — как между мопедом и грузовиком: оба ездят, но задачи разные. В предыдущем пункте я расписал основные отличия. Здесь важно ответить на главный вопрос: какая нужна именно вам?Если у вас маленькая командаи продажи ведёт один-два менеджера, скорее всего, вам подойдёт «мопед» — простая CRM. Она быстро запускается, не требует отдельного обучения и решает главную задачу: чтобы ни одна заявка не потерялась и чтобы сделки двигались по этапам.Если же у вас уже большой отдел продаж, несколько направлений и сложные процессы, без «грузовика» не обойтись. Корпоративные CRM дают аналитику по десяткам показателей, позволяют тонко настраивать роли, строить кастомные воронки и интегрироваться с бухгалтерией или ERP. Но и внедрение требует времени, ресурсов и чаще всего участия интеграторов.Главное правило простое: система должна закрывать необходимый функционал.7. А нужно ли искать нишевое решение, или есть универсальная CRM?В некоторых сферах без специализированных решений не обойтись: в частных клиниках CRM работает вместе с системой ведения истории пациентов, в строительстве важна отчётность по ГОСТам. Но если бизнес не связан с жёсткими регламентами, универсальной CRM будет достаточно — ведь у большинства компаний процессы похожи: поиск клиентов, обработка заявок, продажи и повторные предложения.Хорошая CRM, как и хороший менеджер, подстроится под любую нишу и поможет выстроить продажи.8. Как убедить команду в необходимости CRM и не нарваться на сопротивление?Не говорите «Надо!». Покажите, как CRM решает конкретные проблемы.У менеджера Юли каждый день одна и та же история: клиент просит переслать письмо, а она двадцать минут копается в почте. Скажите ей, что в CRM всё общение и файлы будут в карточке сделки — искать ничего не придётся.А у руководителя свой «больной вопрос»: «Что у нас с продажами?» Он его задаёт так часто, что команда только раздражается. В CRM он сможет открыть готовый отчёт сам — за пару кликов.Когда люди видят решение своих реальных проблем, а не абстрактные «плюсы системы», они воспринимают CRM совсем иначе.9. А если сотрудники не будут пользоваться CRM? Как убедить «старичков» начать в ней работать?Страшный сон руководителя: внедрили систему, потратили время и деньги — а команда продолжает работать по-старому.Обычно дело не в упрямстве, а в том, как именно запускают CRM.Что говорят сотрудники:«Нормально же работали».Блокнот и память кажутся надёжными, пока клиент не спрашивает: «А где обещанная скидка?» — и никто не может вспомнить, кто и что пообещал.«Это сложно».Новая программа выглядит как ещё одна обязанность: нужно разбираться, переносить контакты, привыкать к интерфейсу.«Не вижу пользы».Если CRM выглядит как «большая таблица для начальника», сотрудники не понимают, зачем тратить на неё время.Что с этим делать:Показать пользу для каждого.Подробнее об этом я уже писал в предыдущем вопросе.Дать время на адаптацию.Начните с малого: пусть команда заносит только новые контакты и текущие сделки, а не весь архив за три года.Выбрать простую систему.Если вы работаете не в корпорации, не стоит усложнять себе жизнь навороченными функциями, которые вы, скорее всего, не будете использовать.Привязать CRM к результату.Например, договоритесь, что для KPI учитываются только те сделки, которые занесены в систему. Так у сотрудников появляется стимул фиксировать всё в одном месте.Поддержать обучение.Достаточно одного человека, который освоит CRM первым и покажет остальным, как работать.Общий вывод такой: когда сотрудники видят конкретные выгоды для себя — меньше ручной рутины, меньше неловких разговоров с клиентами, меньше отчётов с нуля — мотивация появляется сама.Настройка CRM10. Кто вообще должен заниматься внедрением — я, айтишник или менеджер?У CRM нет одного ответственного, внедрение всегда командное:Руководительпринимает решение и объясняет, зачем системе место в компании.Менеджерыописывают, как реально устроены продажи, и помогают настроить CRM под эти процессы.IT-отделотвечает за интеграции и техническую поддержку.Продавцыработают в системе каждый день и дают обратную связь: что удобно, а что мешает.Не перекладывайте всё на айтишника. CRM должна решать ваши бизнес-задачи, а не технические.11. Что будет, если я настрою CRM неправильно?Настроить CRM «неправильно» — это как испортить блокнот. Самое страшное — вы потратите пару часов, а потом начнете заново.Начните с самого простого — записывайте в систему клиентов и ежедневные задачи. CRM можно настраивать хоть каждый день, пока не станет удобно всей команде.12. А если я перейду на другую систему — как перенести данные?Большинство CRM поддерживают импорт. Процесс выглядит так:Выгрузите данныеиз старой системы в Excel или CSV. Обычно это контакты, сделки, задачи.Проверьте файл: есть ли там всё нужное и правильно ли подписаны столбцы.Загрузите файлв новую CRM через функцию импорта.Сравните результат— убедитесь, что контакты и сделки подтянулись корректно.Скорость зависит от объёма: база до 500 контактов импортируется за 15–20 минут, большая может занять 1–2 часа.13. Это правда, что CRM может следить за сотрудниками? Она покажет, кто плохо работает?CRM — это не шпионский софт. Она не отслеживает, сколько раз сотрудник выходил покурить. Но система показывает другое:кто закрывает больше сделок,кто забывает перезвонить клиентам,кто реально двигает продажи, а кто создаёт видимость активности.Если менеджер приносит результат, CRM это зафиксирует, независимо от того, сколько часов он провёл за компьютером.Стоимость14. Сколько стоит CRM?Стоимость зависит от функционала и модели оплаты. Обычно есть три варианта:Бесплатные версии.Бесплатные версии.Подойдут небольшим командам — чаще всего ограничены по числу пользователей или по функциям. Но бывают исключения.Например, вот условия нескольких популярных сервисов.СистемаБесплатный тарифУсловияПлатные тарифыYouGileДаДо 10 человек без ограничений по функциям и сроку использованияС 11-го пользователя — 495 ₽/мес. при оплате за год.Битрикс24ДаОграничения по числу пользователей и дисковому пространству (до 5 Гб), урезанный функционал аналитики, интеграций и автоматизации.от 2 490 руб./мес. за 5 пользователей.

А можно ли использовать бесплатную CRM?Конечно, можно, если вам будет достаточно функционала. Чаще всего бесплатные тарифы CRM урезаны: нет автоматизации, интеграций или ограничено количество контактов и сделок.Другой вариант — демо-доступ. Обычно это 7–30 дней, в течение которых можно протестировать все функции системы. Но решение временное.Исключения всё же бывают. У YouGile, например, для команд до десяти человек бесплатный тариф включает все функции без ограничений и по времени, и по возможностям. Даже если у вас компания побольше, можно запустить CRM на одном отделе и понять, подходит ли система всей организации.16. Надо ли платить за настройку или можно внедрить самому?Я составил список критериев, который поможет вам определиться — справитесь ли вы самостоятельно или не стоит заморачиваться и сразу обратиться к интеграторам:Справитесь сами (и сэкономите бюджет), если:У вас малый бизнес до 10 сотрудников.Нужен базовый функционал: ведение клиентов, напоминания, простые отчёты.CRM с интуитивным интерфейсом.Нет сложных интеграций: 1С, IP-телефония, кастомные скрипты.Лучше не рисковать, если у вас:Сложные цепочки согласований, много филиалов.Нестандартные интеграции, например, с ERP.Требуется кастомизация: уникальные отчеты, свои модули.Безопасность17. Что если я потеряю все данные клиентов из CRM?Это вряд ли. Данные о ваших клиентах хранятся в облаке, и система регулярно делает резервные копии. Информацию, которую вы случайно удалили, можно восстановить сочетанием пары клавиш или в архиве.18. CRM видит мои доходы — это безопасно?CRM сама по себе не передаёт цифры во внешние системы, но внутри компании важно настроить права доступа. В большинстве систем это можно сделать гибко (набор опций зависит от конкретного сервиса):ограничить, кто видит какие сделки и клиентов (только свои / отдел / всю базу);разделить доступ к функциям: одни могут создавать сделки, другие только просматривать;скрывать отдельные поля — например, суммы или контакты;ограничивать экспорт базы, чтобы её нельзя было унести за пару кликов.Все действия обычно логируются: видно, кто когда вносил изменения или открывал карточку клиента.19. Можно ли доверять CRM с чувствительными данными клиентов?Доверять можно, если система отвечает базовым требованиям безопасности. Она должна:шифровать данные,требовать надёжную авторизацию,давать возможность ограничивать доступ к информации,позволять стереть данные с потерянного устройства.При этом важно, как именно вы используете CRM. Если пароли или личные контакты сотрудников лежат на виду, никакая система не защитит их от утечки.20. Могут ли конкуренты украсть мои контакты через CRM?Угрозы бывают двух типов:внешние— хакеры и боты, которые ищут уязвимости в системах;внутренние— сотрудники или подрядчики с доступом к базе.Основные методы:фишинг — обманные письма или сайты, через которые у сотрудников выманивают логины и пароли;слабые настройки доступа;уязвимости в ПО или интеграциях;ручной вынос данных (экспорт, фото, копирование).Что снижает риски:многофакторная аутентификация и сильные пароли,ограничение прав доступа,шифрование и резервные копии,логи и мониторинг действий в системе.Вот одинреальный случай: в одной IT-компании менеджер полгода фотографировал на телефон данные из CRM, пока коллеги уходили на обед. Это заметили только тогда, когда резко упал процент продлений. Проверка показала: доступ к файлам был именно у этого сотрудника, и система зафиксировала время входа. По камерам подтвердили — он копировал данные вручную.Компания потеряла часть клиентов и доходов, но вовремя остановила утечку.Вывод простой:важна не только надёжность самой CRM, но и внутренняя политика безопасности.21. А если сотрудник уйдет с базой клиентов?Это один из главных страхов бизнеса. В блокноте или Excel всё действительно зависит от человека: если он увольняется, то и клиенты уходят вместе с ним.CRM работает иначе:Клиенты остаются в системе.Даже если менеджер уходит, база остаётся доступной компании.Доступы можно ограничить.Настройте так, чтобы каждый видел только «своих» клиентов и не мог выгрузить всю базу разом.Все действия фиксируются.Если кто-то попытается скопировать лишнее, это будет видно.Да, стопроцентной гарантии нет: сотрудник может переписать контакты вручную или сфотографировать экран. Но с CRM у вас контроль: клиенты не теряются, сделки продолжают идти, а риски утечки снижаются в разы.Дополнительно стоит позаботиться о том, чтобы отношения клиента были с компанией, а не только с конкретным менеджером.Например, ввести такую политику:Клиент закреплён за менеджером, но история общения и документы хранятся в CRM и доступны команде.Руководитель или коллега подключаются к ключевым сделкам, чтобы у клиента было несколько точек контакта.Регулярные письма, напоминания и сервисные сообщения уходят от компании, а не от конкретного менеджера.Результативность22. Если я установлю CRM, продажи точно вырастут?CRM ― инструмент, который поможет работать эффективнее, а значит, продавать больше. Вы перестанете терять клиентов из-за того, что забываете им перезвонить, будете видеть, какие сделки «горят» и какие менеджеры реально продают, а не делают вид. Значит ли это, что продажи вырастут? Думаю, что да. Например, исследованиеEuroMed Journal for Business Journalпоказало — если организовать в компании анализ данных и ввести CRM, это положительно повлияет на эффективность продаж.23. CRM сама будет искать клиентов?Нет. CRM не заменит маркетинг и продажи: она не ищет клиентов. Но в зависимости от конкретного функционала она может:автоматически собирать входящие заявки с сайта, рекламы и мессенджеров;делать рассылки по вашей клиентской базе или сегментам внутри неё;напоминать менеджерам, когда связаться с клиентом.24. А CRM вообще окупится?Посчитать точную выгоду сложно, но можно прикинуть на примере. Допустим, менеджер забывал перезванивать 10 клиентам в месяц и терял три сделки по 50 000 рублей каждая. Это уже около 150 000 рублей упущенной выручки.Добавим время на ввод нового сотрудника — условно 20 000 рублей в неделю. Плюс, потерянные часы на поиск информации в чатах и почте — ещё тысяч 15.Это грубая оценка, но даже по таким примерным цифрам видно: CRM часто окупается уже на самых простых потерях — забытых звонках и несвоевременных ответах.А какой CRM пользуетесь вы? Почему выбрали именно её?Если есть ещё вопросы — пишите в комментарияхКстати, напомню: вYouGile CRMкоманды до 10 человек могут работать бесплатно — без ограничений по функциям и сроку. Это хороший способ попробовать CRM на практике и понять, нужна ли она вам.Теги:crmcrm-системыcrm программыcrm для малого бизнесаcrm для бизнесапродажисделкиуправление проектомуправление проектами и командойпрограммы для бизнесаХабы:Блог компании YouGileУправление продажамиУправление проектамиУправление персоналомCRM-системы",

Поэтому решил объяснить и я — максимально просто и наглядно.Сразу предупреждаю: в некоторых ответах я привожу в пример бесплатную CRM YouGile. Но на все вопросы о CRM отвечаю чётко и честно ― проверьте сами.Нужна ли CRM и что это такое1. Что вообще такое CRM и зачем она мне?Давайте на примере. Представьте менеджера Анатолия. Он работает в строительной компании и каждый день ведет переговоры с клиентами. У него много объектов, среди которых ремонт офиса на Тверской, отделка кафе на Арбате и перепланировка квартиры в Новой Москве.Типичный понедельник Анатолия без CRM — это:10:00 — владелец кафе просит смету, потому что она затерялась в общем чате.14:00 — собственник квартиры возмущается, потому что ему не перезвонили по дизайн-проекту.17:00 — руководитель требует отчёт по всем объектам, а данные разбросаны по Excel и блокноту.Если бы у Анатолия была CRM, она бы напомнила ему о звонке, собрала отчёт и нашла смету.CRM — это цифровая память вашего бизнеса. Вместо хаоса из Excel, блокнота и чатов — одна система, где видны все клиенты, этапы сделок и пробуксовки.2. Я веду клиентов просто в Excel — зачем мне CRM?Excel — это просто электронный блокнот. Если у вас не больше десяти клиентов, он поможет сохранить их номера телефонов и важные заметки. Но когда клиентов хотя бы несколько десятков, вы тратите время на поиск данных, путаетесь в версиях файлов и пропускаете важные звонки. Если бы у менеджера Анатолия была CRM, он не забыл бы перезвонить клиенту по дизайн-проекту, потому что система напомнит.Excel лишь хранит данные. CRM — помогает заработать деньги.3. Нас всего 3 человека — нам точно нужна CRM?Представьте магазин цветов «Тюльпан». В нем работает три флориста, которые принимают заказы на букеты в мессенджере. Но девушки не были готовы к наплыву заказов на 8 марта и в хаосе сообщений потеряли половину заявок. Как объяснить это рассерженным клиентам, которые не смогли подарить букеты женщинам?А если бы в магазине была CRM, все заявки сохранились бы и их можно было бы быстро отсортировать по статусу или срочности.Владелец «Тюльпана» все равно придет к CRM, когда флористов станет четверо. Но в итоге он потеряет клиентов и потратит вдвое больше времени на перенос данных из чатов.4. CRM — это только для продаж или ещё для чего-то?CRM — как швейцарский нож для увеличения прибыли компании. Продажи — это главное лезвие, но не единственное.Представьте сервисный центр, который занимается ремонтом техники. Владелец научен горьким опытом, поэтому сразу установил CRM, которая:Автоматически напоминает клиентам о ТО, а они оставляют благодарные отзывы.Ведет историю ремонтов, чтобы мастер не спрашивал: «А что у вас там сгорело в прошлый раз?».Контролирует работу мастеров без звонков «Где вы и когда доставите мой холодильник?».CRM — это польза для всей компании.

Надо ли платить за настройку или можно внедрить самому?Я составил список критериев, который поможет вам определиться — справитесь ли вы самостоятельно или не стоит заморачиваться и сразу обратиться к интеграторам:Справитесь сами (и сэкономите бюджет), если:У вас малый бизнес до 10 сотрудников.Нужен базовый функционал: ведение клиентов, напоминания, простые отчёты.CRM с интуитивным интерфейсом.Нет сложных интеграций: 1С, IP-телефония, кастомные скрипты.Лучше не рисковать, если у вас:Сложные цепочки согласований, много филиалов.Нестандартные интеграции, например, с ERP.Требуется кастомизация: уникальные отчеты, свои модули.Безопасность17. Что если я потеряю все данные клиентов из CRM?Это вряд ли. Данные о ваших клиентах хранятся в облаке, и система регулярно делает резервные копии. Информацию, которую вы случайно удалили, можно восстановить сочетанием пары клавиш или в архиве.18. CRM видит мои доходы — это безопасно?CRM сама по себе не передаёт цифры во внешние системы, но внутри компании важно настроить права доступа. В большинстве систем это можно сделать гибко (набор опций зависит от конкретного сервиса):ограничить, кто видит какие сделки и клиентов (только свои / отдел / всю базу);разделить доступ к функциям: одни могут создавать сделки, другие только просматривать;скрывать отдельные поля — например, суммы или контакты;ограничивать экспорт базы, чтобы её нельзя было унести за пару кликов.Все действия обычно логируются: видно, кто когда вносил изменения или открывал карточку клиента.19. Можно ли доверять CRM с чувствительными данными клиентов?Доверять можно, если система отвечает базовым требованиям безопасности. Она должна:шифровать данные,требовать надёжную авторизацию,давать возможность ограничивать доступ к информации,позволять стереть данные с потерянного устройства.При этом важно, как именно вы используете CRM. Если пароли или личные контакты сотрудников лежат на виду, никакая система не защитит их от утечки.20. Могут ли конкуренты украсть мои контакты через CRM?Угрозы бывают двух типов:внешние— хакеры и боты, которые ищут уязвимости в системах;внутренние— сотрудники или подрядчики с доступом к базе.Основные методы:фишинг — обманные письма или сайты, через которые у сотрудников выманивают логины и пароли;слабые настройки доступа;уязвимости в ПО или интеграциях;ручной вынос данных (экспорт, фото, копирование).Что снижает риски:многофакторная аутентификация и сильные пароли,ограничение прав доступа,шифрование и резервные копии,логи и мониторинг действий в системе.Вот одинреальный случай: в одной IT-компании менеджер полгода фотографировал на телефон данные из CRM, пока коллеги уходили на обед. Это заметили только тогда, когда резко упал процент продлений. Проверка показала: доступ к файлам был именно у этого сотрудника, и система зафиксировала время входа. По камерам подтвердили — он копировал данные вручную.Компания потеряла часть клиентов и доходов, но вовремя остановила утечку.Вывод простой:важна не только надёжность самой CRM, но и внутренняя политика безопасности.21. А если сотрудник уйдет с базой клиентов?Это один из главных страхов бизнеса. В блокноте или Excel всё действительно зависит от человека: если он увольняется, то и клиенты уходят вместе с ним.CRM работает иначе:Клиенты остаются в системе.Даже если менеджер уходит, база остаётся доступной компании.Доступы можно ограничить.Настройте так, чтобы каждый видел только «своих» клиентов и не мог выгрузить всю базу разом.Все действия фиксируются.Если кто-то попытается скопировать лишнее, это будет видно.Да, стопроцентной гарантии нет: сотрудник может переписать контакты вручную или сфотографировать экран. Но с CRM у вас контроль: клиенты не теряются, сделки продолжают идти, а риски утечки снижаются в разы.Дополнительно стоит позаботиться о том, чтобы отношения клиента были с компанией, а не только с конкретным менеджером.Например, ввести такую политику:Клиент закреплён за менеджером, но история общения и документы хранятся в CRM и доступны команде.Руководитель или коллега подключаются к ключевым сделкам, чтобы у клиента было несколько точек контакта.Регулярные письма, напоминания и сервисные сообщения уходят от компании, а не от конкретного менеджера.Результативность22. Если я установлю CRM, продажи точно вырастут?CRM ― инструмент, который поможет работать эффективнее, а значит, продавать больше. Вы перестанете терять клиентов из-за того, что забываете им перезвонить, будете видеть, какие сделки «горят» и какие менеджеры реально продают, а не делают вид. Значит ли это, что продажи вырастут? Думаю, что да. Например, исследованиеEuroMed Journal for Business Journalпоказало — если организовать в компании анализ данных и ввести CRM, это положительно повлияет на эффективность продаж.23. CRM сама будет искать клиентов?Нет. CRM не заменит маркетинг и продажи: она не ищет клиентов. Но в зависимости от конкретного функционала она может:автоматически собирать входящие заявки с сайта, рекламы и мессенджеров;делать рассылки по вашей клиентской базе или сегментам внутри неё;напоминать менеджерам, когда связаться с клиентом.24. А CRM вообще окупится?Посчитать точную выгоду сложно, но можно прикинуть на примере. Допустим, менеджер забывал перезванивать 10 клиентам в месяц и терял три сделки по 50 000 рублей каждая. Это уже около 150 000 рублей упущенной выручки.Добавим время на ввод нового сотрудника — условно 20 000 рублей в неделю. Плюс, потерянные часы на поиск информации в чатах и почте — ещё тысяч 15.Это грубая оценка, но даже по таким примерным цифрам видно: CRM часто окупается уже на самых простых потерях — забытых звонках и несвоевременных ответах.А какой CRM пользуетесь вы? Почему выбрали именно её?Если есть ещё вопросы — пишите в комментарияхКстати, напомню: вYouGile CRMкоманды до 10 человек могут работать бесплатно — без ограничений по функциям и сроку. Это хороший способ попробовать CRM на практике и понять, нужна ли она вам.Теги:crmcrm-системыcrm программыcrm для малого бизнесаcrm для бизнесапродажисделкиуправление проектомуправление проектами и командойпрограммы для бизнесаХабы:Блог компании YouGileУправление продажамиУправление проектамиУправление персоналомCRM-системы",

        "title": "1 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stock to Buy Right Now",
        "lead": "This is at least one stock Buffett and the investing community agree on.",
        "text": "It's hard to believe that Warren Buffett's time as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway is coming to an end. The legendary investor took the holding company from a textile manufacturer in 1965 to become one of the largest companies on the planet today, owning more than 100 businesses and with an equity portfolio worth more than $300 billion.Berkshire Hathaway stock has wildly outperformed the market over these past few decades, delivering a total gain of 5,502,284% in per-share market value vs. 39,054% for the S&P 500. Today, Berkshire Hathaway has joined the ranks of the $1 trillionmarket capclub, and investors everywhere follow Buffett's trades and guidance to become more successful investors.Most Buffett holdings are the antithesis of the hot growth stock. Buffett is known for hisvalue approach to investing, and he steers clear of high-risk stocks or technology that he's not familiar with. But at least one stock that the broader investing community and Warren Buffett can agree upon is Amazon (AMZN-1.34%).The classic moatThere are several features Buffett loves in a great stock, and one of them is a moat. Aneconomic moatensures that the business has a product or service that stands out and a leg up on the competition. Amazon's size and name give it a competitive edge, so even though it's not the classic Buffett stock, it has some clear features that fit the mold.Its core business is of course e-commerce, and it has almost 40% of the market share in the U.S. That's a massive amount of market share for any business, and Amazon can do so much to keep its share because it's so large and has so many resources. It hasn't reported the number of Prime members it has in a while, but it's estimated at 220 million to 240 million. These members rely on it for their everyday essentials and more, and the membership model generates loyalty and repeat purchases.It also drives growth in its advertising business, since advertisers get access to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members where they're already shopping and ready to make a purchase. More recently, Amazon has developed a robust video ad business for its Prime streaming platform, and it's also expanding the business outside of the Amazon platform.Amazon's market share lead isn't quite as big in cloud computing, but it's still hefty at 30% of the global market, well ahead of Microsoft Azure's 20%.Opportunities in AIAmazon is in constant growth mode to stay on top of its game in all of its categories. Its greatest opportunities today lie in generative artificial intelligence (AI) through its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in developing the most competitive generative AI capabilities to meet every kind of demand, from the small business through its large enterprise clients.Its signature AI service is calledBedrock, which provides access to a plethora of large-language models (LLM) for clients to customize, but it also has tools for developers to build their own LLMs and for small businesses to use ready-made solutions.The AI business already has a $123 billionrun rate, and CEO Andy Jassy pointed out, \"How often do you have an opportunity that's $123 billion of annual revenue run rate where you say it's still early?\"Indeed, independent sources point to a massive long-term opportunity. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $3.5 trillion by 2033, growing at acompound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 31.5%. What we see today continues to grow at a pace that's hard to keep up with as generative AI moves from wonky results to near-human content creation.Amazon and its peers are using enormous loads of data to access new levels of training, inference, and reasoning, reaching new capabilities that could further revolutionize daily life. The way it's going, AI could eventually take over as Amazon's larger business and launch its stock into new territory.A great time to buyDespite its immense size, Amazon's revenue is still growing by double digits -- 12% in the second quarter. That's quite a feat, and with the potential for the AI business, it could keep that up for a while. However, there's some uncertainty in the business due to tariffs and lawsuits, and the market has soured on Amazon stock recently; it's roughly flat this year, despite the ongoing opportunities.At the current price, Amazon stock trades at 29 timesforward, 1-year earnings, which is an attractive entry point for new investors. If you've been on the fence, now could be a fantastic time to take a position in this no-brainer stock.",

Foreign investors keep adding. We’re not alone; several other countries are seeing new highs as well. The global index is also at a record level, as is the global index ex-USA. The bias to equity versus debt has never been higher. Corporate share buybacks have never been higher,” he added.However, a stark divergence has emerged between professional and retail investors, as new Bank of America data shows “Wall Street is selling to Main Street again.” U.S. equities saw a net outflow of $4.7 billion last week, overwhelmingly driven by institutional players cashing out.Institutional investors led the charge, dumping $3.6 billion in stocks—their largest weekly sell-off since June. Hedge funds followed suit, offloading $1.3 billion, marking their third consecutive week of net selling. This exodus from so-called “smart money” contributed to one of the largest two-week outflows from single stocks since 2008, signaling a significant move to de-risk portfolios.In sharp contrast, retail investors embraced the downturn as a chance to “buy the dip.” For the first time in four weeks, this cohort became net buyers, purchasing a total of $200 million in equities.This classic market dynamic, where seasoned institutions sell into buying from individual investors, is often viewed as a cautionary indicator. It highlights a critical split in sentiment, raising questions about whether retail optimism will be rewarded or if the institutional flight signals turbulence ahead for the market.See Also:How to Trade FuturesUpcoming Economic DataHere's what investors will be keeping an eye on Friday;September’s U.S. employment report, unemployment rate, and hourly wages data, which was supposed to be out by 8:30 a.m. ET, will not be released because of the government shutdown.September’s S&P final U.S. services PMI and ISM services data will also be delayed.Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson will speak at 1:40 p.m. ET.Stocks In FocusActelis Networks Inc.

По его словам, в начале СВО операторы БПЛА редко становились мишенью и гибли, но сейчас это происходит гораздо чаще.Джастин Бронк, старший научный сотрудник по вопросам военно-воздушных сил и технологий Королевского института объединенных оборонных исследований (британского аналитического центра), написал в августовском отчете , что число потерь среди украинских пилотов беспилотников возросло \"стремительными темпами\" весной и летом этого года.Растущее стремление ликвидировать операторов беспилотников подчеркивает колоссальное влияние, которое дроны оказывают на ведение боевых действий, отмечает Business Insider.#беспилотники#Украина",

        "text": "Prominent Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives is forecasting an imminent surge of mergers and acquisitions across the technology sector, declaring that the artificial intelligence (AI) “M&A floodgates are ready to be opened.”Top AI M&A Picks By Dan IvesCiting an intensifying “AI arms race,” Ives has identified a watchlist of prime takeover targets, including cybersecurity firms and consumer tech companies.In a recent note to clients reportedbyCNBC and a post on X, Ives argued that both strategic and financial buyers are gearing up for a flurry of acquisitions.He pointed to a more lenient regulatory landscape as a key catalyst that will make it easier for deals to close. “We believe that the tech M&A floodgates are ready to be opened as more opportunities arise to add accretive assets with an easier path forward,” Ives stated.His comprehensive list of M&A targets also features C3.ai Inc. (NYSE:AI), SanDisk Corp. (NASDAQ:SNDK), Tenable Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:TENB), SentinelOne Inc. (NYSE:S), Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS), Varonis Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:VRNS), Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC), and Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP).Which Firms Are Likely To Acquire AI Players?Ives anticipates that tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), which he suggests are playing catch-up in the AI race, will be among the most highly acquisitive firms during this wave.AI M&A Activity Is Already UnderwayThe prediction comes as the industry has already seen significant M&A activity, such as CoreWeave Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:CRWV)deal forCore Scientific Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:CORZ) data centers.Also, Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)reported the acquisition ofCyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR).Ives expects this trend to accelerate as large-scale tech players look to buy niche AI use cases to expand their product portfolios.IVES ETF Crosses $750 Million In AUMThe forecast carries significant weight in the market, where Ives has established himself as an influential voice on tech trends.His analysis is the foundation of the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (NYSE:IVES), which recently underscored strong investor confidence by surpassing $750 million in assets under management just months after its launch in June 2025.It has risen 30.18% since its listing.Price ActionThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, rose on Thursday.

As it prepares to release its quarterly earnings on October 9, 2025, analysts are keenly observing the company's financial performance. The expected earnings per share (EPS) is $1.56, with projected revenue of approximately $15.94 billion. Despite a recent dip from its peak in early September, Delta's stock has shown resilience, maintaining a 47.2% increase over the past six months. The $56 level is emerging as a crucial support floor, potentially stabilizing the stock. Historically, Delta's stock has demonstrated a bullish trend, with a 69% chance of rising one month after similar instances, averaging a 5.6% gain. Delta's consistent performance in surpassing earnings estimates positions it favorably for another potential earnings beat. In the last two quarters, Delta exceeded expectations by an average of 8.97%. For instance, in the most recent quarter, the airline reported earnings of $2.04 per share against an anticipated $2.10, marking a 2.94% surprise. The company's financial metrics provide insight into its market valuation. Delta's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is approximately 8.23, while its price-to-sales ratio stands at about 0.60. The enterprise value to sales ratio is around 0.89, and the enterprise value to operating cash flow ratio is approximately 7.46. These figures reflect Delta's valuation relative to its earnings, sales, and cash flow. Delta's debt-to-equity ratio is approximately 1.22, indicating its reliance on debt financing.
